<p>About a year ago <a href="https://drewtyre.rbind.io/mental-health/">I disclosed my depression to the interwebs</a>.
It seems timely to revisit the topic.</p>
<p>On the whole, telling people about my depression was a positive
experience. My colleagues were very supportive.
I made new friends as people reached out to have lunch and talk about science
fiction and cooking. I didn’t hear any official reaction, but through the
grapevine came rumbles of my blog post triggering discussions in various student
support groups throughout the university.</p>
<p>Despite my positive experience, disclosure isn’t the right move for everyone.
I am so lucky to be surrounded by nice people. But someone else may not be in
such a safe place. I am also at a point in my career where I can remain
successful even if some people choose not to work with me because of my
mental health issues, or my public stance on those issues. I expect I have
lost research opportunities because of my previous post, and this one won’t help.
Many, maybe all, of these opportunities are lost because people want to be
helpful, and not
add anything when I’m clearly already struggling. I’m OK with that; I’ve got
enough to do, and I need to say “No” a lot more.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t anticipate was the number of people who wanted to talk to me
about their mental health. I listened attentively, encouraged them to seek
professional help, and worked my butt off trying not to get attached to their
outcomes. I have a much greater appreciation for the work of therapists and
counselors now. One such meeting leaves me exhausted, head spinning with
questions about what I said, what should I have said, did I do enough. I’ll still say
yes every time I’m asked.</p>

<h2>Creating an environment of access</h2>
<p>Last summer the Natural Resources Diversity Initiative invited me to lead a
discussion on mental health during fall semester. As I was feeling so much better,
sure! Great idea! It turned out great, but the week before I was an anxious wreck.
Normally when I speak in public I am an expert in the topic. My only
qualification was personal experience.</p>
<p>I asked for suggestions on
Twitter – that turned out to be a mixed benefit. On the one hand, lots of
supportive replies to just tell my story, and it’ll be great. On the
other were outright critical replies telling me to turn it over to a mental
health professional, or worrying that graduate student complaints would dilute the lived
experience of genuinely ill people. I left Twitter alone for the better part of
a month after that.</p>
<p>The thing is, we’ve had presentations from “the proper authorities.” This was my
colleagues saying “we want even more discussion!” I reached out to our university
Counseling and Psychological Services about this discussion and got no reply –
they are swamped. And at the
meeting a few genuinely ill people spoke up and shared their experience. People
get it. This isn’t about graduate student whining. This is about realizing that
mental health is as important as physical health. I adapted <a href="https://caps.unl.edu/big-red-folder">some material I
found on the CAPS website</a> to a “myth or fact”
activity. I told my story, did the exercise, and let the discussion flow after
that. It went really well.</p>
<p>During the discussion one of my colleagues asked a great question to which I had
no answer. I still don’t, but I’ve since realized the question itself reflects the
stigma attached to mental health. Paraphrased, “What do we do when a student suffers
depression, and is unable to complete the work required by the funding agency?”
The answer is, the same thing you’d do if the student was diagnosed with cancer,
or became pregnant! Mental illness isn’t any different from a physical illness or condition
that leaves a student unable to complete the work. In fact, with proper support and
treatment, a mentally ill student may well be able to complete the work. The “proper
support” is where mental health professionals play a key role.</p>

<h2>Meltdown</h2>
<p>Last summer my colleague Leon was diagnosed with cancer. [ask leon if he is ok with this]
<a href="http://snr.unl.edu/aboutus/who/people/faculty-member.asp?pid=1921">Joe Dauer</a> and I took over
the Intro ecology course to allow Leon to focus on healing and recovery. I was doing well
and it seemed like a doable thing, co-teaching ecology and organizing the ecology lab at
the same time. I was super-excited to teach
with Joe, one of the educational research faculty at UNL. I expected to learn a lot. I wasn’t
disappointed! It was an awesome experience. Unfortunately it was also a little too
much.</p>
<p>I’d also agreed to organize the ecology lab for the spring semester on top of my regular
teaching. It was a good idea, really. We need to bring the fall and spring versions
into greater alignment, and having me take over the spring semester as well
would facilitate that. I was self-aware enough to recognize that a second semester
of double teaching would do me in, so I had started working with John, my boss, to delegate
and transfer some other responsibilities. I made it through the fall semester, but
once grades were in, the pressure came off, and my mood slipped day by day.</p>
<p>The random crying jags struck about four days after I turned in
my grades. On a whim, I stopped in to see John and update him on my plans for the
spring semester. What I didn’t plan on was bursting into tears in his office.
I left completely deflated, but with strict orders that I would
not be teaching ecology lab or doing several other things this spring.</p>
<p>I arranged an emergency visit with my counselor. It was only five minutes into the
conversation when he asked if I would check myself in to the psychiatric ward at
our local hospital. That really drove home how bad I was. More discussion
of that option revealed I wasn’t actively suicidal, so not needed, but ouch.
That was a wake up call for sure.</p>
<p>Next stop, back to my GP to see about medication. I sat there, twitching<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, rubbing my hands
together anxiously, barely holding back tears while describing the situation to
the nurse. My GP took one look and started me on a low dose of an atypical anti-psychotic<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Remarkably, that shut off the depression symptoms like flipping a switch. Unfortunately I was
tired and foggy all the time. I started working with a psychiatrist to review and
evaluate all my medication, hopeful that an
effective combination with few side effects can be found. I was really tired of
the merry-go-round.</p>
<p>One clear positive note in all this: counselling helps. One of the questions to diagnose
depression is something to the effect of “Do you have thoughts of worthlessness”. When
the nurses asked me this, I had to stop and think. I was amazed to realize the answer
was no, none. Not one. That’s the counselling. Unreasoned sadness, check. Suicidal
ideation, check. But I don’t think I’m worthless. Medication plus counseling. It just works.</p>

<h2>Current State and the Future</h2>
<p>I’m experiencing some fairly immediate improvements from a couple of medication changes.
But I’ve often had short term gains followed by long term mediocrity, so the jury is still out.
The changes are based on a genetic test which I’ll write about elsewhere. But I’m
kind of excited.</p>
<p>My counselor reminds me often that thoughts create reality. A friend reminded me that
words are thoughts pinned in space-time
by sound or text. I want to create a reality of health, so here’s what that looks like.
My “quietly confident”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> mind generates new ideas and readily produces clear descriptions of
those ideas. I get through an 8 hour day with energy and motivation to spare.
I use that excess energy to spend quality time with friends and family, and on
activities that refresh me. I have the willpower to
exercise daily. I manage my time effectively, helping others, but also making time to
do the things that advance my interests.</p>
<p>Wellness is a process. I’m struggling now, but
on an upward path. I’ve surrounded myself with living things<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and my
family is close at hand. I am hopeful.</p>

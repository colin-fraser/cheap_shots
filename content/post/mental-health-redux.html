<p>About a year ago <a href="https://drewtyre.rbind.io/mental-health/">I disclosed my depression to the interwebs</a>.
It seems timely to revisit the topic.</p>
<p>On the whole, telling people about my experience of depression was a positive
experience. This is likely a result of my privileged position – not everyone
would experience such an outcome. My colleagues were very supportive.
I made new friends as people reached out to have lunch and talk about science
fiction novels and cooking. I didn’t hear any official reaction, but through the
grapevine came rumbles of my blog post triggering discussions in various student
support groups throughout the university.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t anticipate was the number of people who wanted to talk to me
about their mental health. I listened attentively, encouraged them to seek
professional help, and worked my butt off trying not to get attached to their
outcomes! I have a much greater appreciation for the work of therapists and
councilors now. One such meeting leaves me exhausted, head spinning with
questions about what I said, what should I have said, did I do enough. I’ll still say
yes everytime I’m asked.</p>

<h2>Creating an environment of access</h2>
<p>Last summer the Natural Resources Diversity Initiative invited me to lead a
discussion on mental health during fall semester. As I was feeling so much better,
sure! Great Idea! It turned out great, but the week before I was an anxious wreck. My only
qualification is a lack of the quantity in question! I asked for suggestions on
twitter – that turned out to be a mixed benefit. On the one hand, lots of
supportive replies telling me to just tell my story, and it’ll be great. On the
other were outright critical replies telling me to turn it over to a mental
health professional, or worrying that graduate student complaints would dilute the lived
experience of genuinely ill people. I left twitter alone for the better part of
a month after that.</p>
<p>The thing is, we’ve had presentations from “the proper authorities”. This was my
colleagues saying “we want even more discussion!”. I reached out to our university
Counseling and Psychological Services about this discussion and got no reply –
they are swamped. And at the
meeting a few genuinely ill people spoke up and shared their experience. People
get it. This isn’t about graduate student whining. This is about realizing that
mental health is as important as physical health. I adapted <a href="https://caps.unl.edu/big-red-folder">some material I
found on the CAPS website</a> to a “myth or fact”
activity. I told my story, did the exercise, and let the discussion flow after
that. It went really well.</p>
<p>During the discussion one of my colleagues asked a great question to which I had
no answer. I still don’t, but I’ve since realized the question itself reflects the
stigma attached to mental health. Paraphrased, “What do we do when a student suffers
depression, and is unable to complete the work required by the funding agency?”
The answer is, the same thing you’d do if the student was diagnosed with cancer,
or became pregnant! Which probably still doesn’t help with most funding agencies,
but the point is that it isn’t any different from a physical illness or condition
that leaves a student unable to complete the work.</p>

<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>Last summer a colleague was diagnosed with cancer.
<a href="http://snr.unl.edu/aboutus/who/people/faculty-member.asp?pid=1921">Joe Dauer</a> and I took over
the Intro ecology course to allow him to focus on healing and recovery. I was doing well
and it seemed like a doable thing, co-teaching ecology and organizing the lab at
the same time. I was super excited to teach
with Joe, one of the DBER faculty at UNL. I expected to learn a lot. I wasn’t
disappointed! It was an awesome experience. Unfortunately it was also a little too
much.</p>
<p>I’d also agreed to organize the ecology lab for the spring semester on top of my regular
teaching. It was a good idea, really. We need to bring the fall and spring versions
into greater alignment, and having me take over the spring semester as well
would facilitate that. I was self-aware enough to recognize that a 2nd semester
of double teaching would do me in, so I had started working with John, my boss, to delegate
and transfer some other responsibilities. I made it through the fall semester, but
once grades were in, the pressure came off, and my mood slipped day by day.</p>
<p>Some involuntary twitching<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> developed over the last few weeks of the semester.
In hindsight that was an early warning sign that I’d stretched myself beyond
capacity. As it was, the random crying jags struck about 4 days after I turned in
my grades. On a whim, I stopped in to see John and update him on my plans for the
spring semester. What I didn’t plan on was bursting into tears in his office.
I left more or less completely deflated, but with strict orders that I would
not be teaching ecology lab or doing several other things this spring.</p>
<p>I arranged an emergency visit with my counselor. It was only 5 minutes into the
conversation when he asked if I would check myself in to the psychiatric ward at
our local hospital. That really drove home how bad I was. More discussion
of that option revealed I wasn’t actively suicidal, so not needed, but ouch.
That was a wakeup call for sure.</p>
<p>Next stop, back to my GP to see about medication. I sat there, twitching, rubbing my hands
together anxiously, barely holding back tears while describing the situation to
the nurse. My GP took one look and started me on a low dose of Aripiprazole (Brand name Abilify).
Remarkably, that shut off the depression symptoms like flipping a switch. The drawback is I’m
tired and foggy all the time. I’m now working with a psychiatrist to review and
evaluate all my medication, and I’m hopeful that with a greater effort a
effective combination with few side effects can be found. I’m really tired of
this merry-go-round.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself that wellness is a process. I’m struggling now, but
there is hope. I’ve surrounded myself with living things<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and my
family is always close at hand.</p>

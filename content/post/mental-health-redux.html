<p>About a year ago <a href="https://drewtyre.rbind.io/mental-health/">I disclosed my depression to the interwebs</a>.
It seems timely to revisit the topic.</p>
<p>On the whole, telling people about my experience of depression was a positive
experience. This is likely a result of my privileged position – not everyone
would have experienced such an outcome. My colleagues were very supportive.
I made new friends as people reached out to have lunch and talk about science
fiction novels and cooking. I didn’t hear any official reaction, but through the
grapevine came rumbles of my blog post triggering discussions in various student
support groups throughout the university.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t anticipate was the number of people who wanted to talk to me
about their mental health. I listened attentively, encouraged them to seek
professional help, and worked my butt off trying not to get attached to their
outcomes! I have a much greater appreciation for the work of therapists and
councilors now. One such meeting leaves me exhausted, head spinning with
questions about what I said, what should I have said, did I do enough.</p>
<p>Last fall the Natural Resources Diversity Initiative invited me to lead a
discussion on mental health. As I was feeling so much better, sure! Great Idea!
It turned out great, but the week before I was an anxious wreck. My only
qualification is a lack of the quantity in question! I asked for suggestions on
twitter – that turned out to be a mixed benefit. On the one hand, lots of
supportive replies telling me to just tell my story, and it’ll be great. On the
other were outright critical replies telling me to turn it over to a mental
health professional, or worrying that graduate student complaints would dilute the lived
experience of genuinely ill people. I left twitter alone for the better part of
a month after that.</p>
<p>The thing is, we’ve had presentations from “the proper authorities”. This was my
colleagues saying “we want even more discussion!”. I reached out to our university
Counseling and Psychological Services about this discussion and got no reply –
they are swamped. And at the
meeting a few genuinely ill people spoke up and shared their experience. People
get it. This isn’t about graduate student whining. This is about realizing that
mental health is as important as physical health. I adapted <a href="https://caps.unl.edu/big-red-folder">some material I
found on the CAPS website</a> to a “myth or fact”
activity. I told my story, did the exercise, and let the discussion flow after
that. It went really well.</p>
<p>During the discussion one of my colleagues asked a great question to which I had
no answer. I still don’t, but I’ve since realized the question itself reflects the
stigma attached to mental health. Paraphrased, “What do we do when a student suffers
depression, and is unable to complete the work required by the funding agency?”
The answer is, the same thing you’d do if the student was diagnosed with cancer,
or became pregnant! Which probably still doesn’t help with most funding agencies,
but the point is that it isn’t any different from a physical illness or condition
that leaves a student unable to complete the work.</p>
<p>Current state</p>
<p>I have to remind myself that wellness is a process. I’m struggling now, but
there is hope. I’ve surrounded myself with living things<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and my
family is always close at hand.</p>

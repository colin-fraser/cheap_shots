<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r/">The first post in this series was a week and a half ago</a>, in case you’re just joining and
want to see the progression.</p>
<div id="the-bottom-line" class="section level1">
<h1>The bottom line</h1>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The figure below is complex, so I’ll highlight some
features first. The y axis is now cases / 100,000 population to make it easier to compare Italy
and the USA. The SOLID LINES are exponential growth models that assume
the rate of increase is <em>constant</em>. The dashed lines are predictions from that
model. To make comparison easier, the estimated model and predictions for both countries are on both panels.
The lines and intervals for the other country are faded out. The horizontal DOTTED LINES
are the number of ICU beds per 100,000 population in each country. Note that
the y axis is logarithmic.</p>

<p>Below are the same calculations but focused in on 3 US states and 3 Canadian provinces[^2].
Each panel has the same features as the graph above.</p>

<p>Looks to me like Washington and New York are showing signs of a slow down in the rate of growth.
New york is still within the prediction interval, but the last 4 days the new cases are closer to
linear.</p>
<p>Here are a few more states people have asked for, along with New York for comparison</p>
<p><img src="/post/covid-19_in_R_IX_files/figure-html/cone-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The South Dakota, and Nebraska regressions are not statistically significant.
In Nebraska that line is very encouraging. We have
already put in place measures to reduce transmission rates, so maybe that will be early
enough to blunt the epidemic
here.</p>
<p>Tomas Pueyo had another good post on Medium where <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56">he articulated the “Hammer and Dance” strategy.</a>
It’s the best description yet of what South Korea, Singapore et al. are doing, and translated into US and
western sensibility generally. Gave me a bit of hope that we might be able to ease back on the
hammer in weeks rather than months, and minimize the economic damage. Key piece is to reduce transmission
as much as possible (that’s on us), and a massive testing effort to identify where the virus is and get exposed people in quarantine (that’s on the government).
All that buys time. Time for a vaccine to be developed, time for medical science to identify drugs that can
help, time for manufacturing to spool up increased PPE production for frontline medical staff. Time is what
we need.</p>

<p>I removed the points as well to reduce clutter. The most remarkable thing about that figure is the
consistency of the slopes for 4 locales. New York is the one growing faster than the others. British
Columbia is the one growing slower.</p>
<p>David Harris, a FaceBook correspondent, asked why I was using incident cases instead of cumulative cases.
I gave a half-baked answer at the time, but really the reason is because
<a href="https://timchurches.github.io/blog/posts/2020-03-01-analysing-covid-19-2019-ncov-outbreak-data-with-r-part-2/#modelling-epidemic-trajectory-in-hubei-province-using-log-linear-models">Tim Church used incident cases in his example modelling post</a>. I was
thinking that cumulative cases is misleading because it ignores recoveries and deaths. However …
the JHU data set includes numbers for recoveries and deaths. So it is straightforward to subtract
those off and get something like “active cases”. And that would be directly proportional to
the load on the healthcare system.</p>

<p>“Flattening the curve” is clearer in this plot for California, Washington, and New York. The
autocorrelation I’ve been ignoring is also clearer, especially in the New York plot. The points
“wave” up and down around the expected value. The red line is per capita ICU beds by <em>country</em>, so
could be different by state or province. The comparison between the points and the ICU line is affected
by one question – what proportion of “active cases” need ICU support? If the “Confirmed” cases were ALL
of the COVID-19 cases, then the red line is too low by a factor of 5-20. However, we know that not
all cases are being tested and “confirmed”. Confirmed cases right now are overwhelmingly the ones that
are really sick. So the dotted line is a “lower bound” that assumes all reported cases need ICU support. Maybe
that should be a region of uncertainty between ICU beds and 20 x ICU beds.</p>

avoiding it.</p>

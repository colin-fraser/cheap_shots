Trying something new -- all plots for provinces with sufficient data. 
Click the name of the locale you want to see. Tabs would be better, but for reasons
beyond my ken, automatic tabsets don't work with blogdown. 

[The first post in this series was on March 13](/post/covid-19_and_r/), in case you're just joining and
want to see the progression. 

DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time, 
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.[^1] 

The figures below are complex, so I'll highlight some
features first. The y axis is now Active and Recovered cases / 100,000 population to make it easier to compare locales. The SOLID LINES are exponential growth models that assume
the rate of increase is *constant*. The dashed lines are predictions from that
model. The red rectangle shows the range of ICU bed capacity per 100,000 population.
The lower limit assumes all reported cases need ICU care (unlikely, but worst case). The 
top of the rectangle assumes only 5% of cases need ICU support. That best case assumes that the
confirmed cases are a good representation of the size of the outbreak (also unlikely, unfortunately).
Note that the y axis is logarithmic. The x axis is days since the 20th case in each province.

If the figure is blank there is insufficient data to build the model. 

```{r featured_image, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("broom")
library("forecast")
savefilename <- "data/api_all_2020-04-02.Rda"
# The following code is commented out and left in place. This isn't particularly good coding 
# practice, but I don't want to have to rewrite it every day when I get the updated data.
# I archive the data rather than pull fresh because this data source is very volatile, and
# data that worked with this code yesterday might break today.
# api_confirmed_countries <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/countries/cases.csv")
# api_deaths_countries <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/countries/deaths.csv")
# api_recoveries_countries <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/countries/recoveries.csv")
# api_confirmed_regions <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/regions/cases.csv")
# api_deaths_regions <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/regions/deaths.csv")
# api_recoveries_regions <- read_csv("https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/v1/regions/recoveries.csv")
# save(api_confirmed_countries, api_deaths_countries, api_recoveries_countries,
#      api_confirmed_regions, api_deaths_regions, api_recoveries_regions,
#      file = savefilename)
load(savefilename)

country_data <- read_csv("data/countries_covid-19.csv") %>% 
  mutate(start_date = mdy(start_date)) 

source("R/jhu_helpers.R")
source("R/plot_functions.R")


canada_by_region <- list(
  confirmed = other_wide2long(api_confirmed_regions, countries = "Canada"),
  deaths = other_wide2long(api_deaths_regions, countries = "Canada"),
  # recovered data is a mess lots of missing values
  recoveries = other_wide2long(api_recoveries_regions, countries = "Canada")
  ) %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "variable") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = cumulative_cases)

canada_template <- c(
    "<details><summary>{{nm}}</summary>\n",
    "```{r {{nm}}, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\n",
    "tmp <- canada_by_region %>% filter(Region == \"{{nm}}\") %>% \n",
    "plot_active_case_growth(x = ., country_data)\n",
    "tmp$.plot\n",
    "```\n",
    "</details>\n"
  )

plots <- lapply(
  unique(canada_by_region$Region), 
  function(nm) knitr::knit_expand(text = canada_template)
)

```

`r knitr::knit(text = unlist(plots))`

One of the drawbacks to this approach is that I can't provide any interpretation of the figures. 
Please post questions in the comment section at the bottom!

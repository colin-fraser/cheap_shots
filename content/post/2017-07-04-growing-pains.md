So I've kicked the ball on migrating to blogdown/hugo/netlify! I was invited to join the community at support.rbind.io, so that was the proximate cause of the migration. That and I didn't have anything planned for the 4th. 

This post is just a list of things that stump(ed) me during the migration process. Maybe this will help down the path.

- [ ] There are a bunch of social sharing icons appearing on my posts! I think I have to edit the theme in order to disappear them.

<p>I tried something completely different: acupuncture. I wouldn’t
have considered it at all, but I’ve known Lezlie Abbott at Nebraska Acupuncture for
a long time. So why not. I figure anything that’s been around for millenia must
have some efficacy. Even if the underlying model of classical eastern medicine is
wrong, it might still make accurate predictions. Machine learning works, after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All models are wrong, but some of them are useful.

</blockquote>
<p>One of the things that impressed me the most about that first session was the level
of detail in Lezlie’s observations. A western doctor takes your pulse, and records the
frequency. I don’t know what Lezlie was looking for, but she took my pulse in both
wrists and recorded at least 12 different bits of information. She looked at my
tongue. She asked me how often I blow my nose – often several times per hour – and
was surprised at that answer. After quizzing me
and recording a complete medical history, she loaded me up with needles.</p>
<p>Most of the needles I couldn’t feel going in. A few I felt for a moment, but
after a second or two the sensation was gone. The two exceptions were one in my
right lower leg, and another in the side of my right wrist. Both generated an
achy sensation. Leslie wiggled (probably a technical term there) a few of the
needles around after inserting them.
There were needles sticking out of me from head to toe. Then she
left me alone for 20 minutes. I took the opportunity to practice mindfulness
meditation.</p>
<p>Pulling the needles out generated more feeling than putting them in, but quickly
gone. When I went to sit up on the table, I nearly couldn’t do it – like my abs
had been unplugged. I had to roll over on my side and get up gradually. I felt
very relaxed.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking for this change, but over the next couple of days it seemed like
my sinuses weren’t draining as much as usual. Confirmation bias and all that, so
I’ve started recording my kleenex use. I’m going back for another acupuncture session
in two weeks, so I’ll have a good baseline to compare.</p>

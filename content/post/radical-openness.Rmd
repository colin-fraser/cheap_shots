A few days ago I participated in a discussion about responding to a freedom of 
information request. The requesters wanted the formula for the model developed 
by myself and others for a state agency. At the time, I mused that if we had
posted all the code and data for the project on github, the request would be 
redundant. I was told that it was necessary to only give requesters exactly 
what they asked for. So we did. But.

# Why not make the code and data open? 

I can think of one reason: maintain 
agency authority over the decision making process. If no one else has the 
information, then no one else can criticize or take over the decision. But this
is patently false. Ballot initiatives tie the hands of Agencies across the country. 
**Make a table of ballot initiatives**
These initiatives were not stopped by agencies keeping their data and analyses
secret. I don't know if having the data in the open would have stopped a ballot initiative
either, but it seems a reasonable hypothesis to try out. 

[Some good stuff on this page.](https://www.outdoorlife.com/articles/hunting/2016/01/it-time-rethink-north-american-model-wildlife-conservation/)

Keeping the data and analyses secret provides another advantage: it hides the trade offs
that decision makers are making. There are unavoidable trade offs in natural 
resources management. There is no way to make all stakeholders perfectly happy. 
If there were, then those decisions aren't going to be challenged. If an agency
simply tells stakeholders what the decision is, then perhaps some will be 
happy, some merely satisfied, and others outraged. But no one will be able to
tell the extent to which their concerns were traded away to advantage someone
else. 

# Reasons to make the data and code open

I like to think about these issues in the context of a three-legged stool model
of the science-policy interface [@buzan2005]: credibility, salience, and legitimacy. 
All three of those are affected by how much a group of stakeholders trusts the agency.

## Increase trust

The more trust stakeholders have in an agency, the more likely they are to accept 
a decision. **check for trust citations** Placing the code and data in the open
should increase trust, because look ma, nothing up either sleeve! But that only
works if it is also clear how the analyses contributed to the decision, and
ultimately that means exposing the trade offs involved. 

## Increase credibility

Scientists are used to building credibility by exposing their work to peer review
as part of the publishing process. But a lot of agency work doesn't get peer 
reviewed, because it isn't really pushing science forward. Putting the data and
code out in the open invites constructive criticism -- stakeholders can see 
what choices were made in the analysis. In fact, they can take the data and make
different choices and see if that affects the results. Making the work public
will also lead to better work -- no room to be sloppy and no carpet to hide
sketchy assumptions under. 

## Expose salience

The analysis should already be salient to the decision, because the work is done
to support the decision. But it might not be obvious to stakeholders how the work
is connected to the decision. Agencies might consider that a feature rather than 
a bug, but I think it is something that should be fixed.

## Increase legitimacy

I think of legitimacy of the analysis as the "3rd rail" of the science policy
interface -- touch it and your contribution is dead to the stakeholders. One 
way to increase legitimacy is to involve stakeholders in the process of defining
the science. Opening a repository with code and data for an analysis explicitly
provides a place for that conversation to happen. It might not be the best place,
but something seems better than nothing. 


# Conclusion

I don't have rose-colored glasses on; radical openness won't make conflict with
stakeholders go away. But I think it could change the nature of that conflict for
the better. 

# Postscript

I learned some more details about the request for information on a phone call. 
One stakeholder group, representing fur trappers, wants a particular action to be taken. As far as I can tell,
the action would cost the agency nothing, and the stakeholders in question are
the only ones who would experience a (slight if not zero) negative effect. 
Nonetheless, the agency doesn't think the action is warranted. The stakeholders 
feel that a population of trappable animals is declining precipitously, and they
want the population closed to trapping. The agency thinks there are very few 
animals there (poor habitat), and there have always been few animals there. 
Closing the population to trapping admits that the stakeholders' view is correct. 

There is an opportunity here to have a different kind of conversation about
the management. There are clearly two hypotheses: the population is declining
because of trapping, or the population is low because of poor habitat. These
hypotheses make very different predictions about what will happen after closing
the management area. If trapping is the problem, then after closure the population
will start to increase. If habitat is the problem, then after closure nothing
will change. We could do [adaptive management](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/natrespapers/302/!

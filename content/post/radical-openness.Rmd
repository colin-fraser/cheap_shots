A few days ago I participated in a discussion about responding to a freedom of 
information request. The requesters wanted the formula for the model developed 
by myself and others for a state agency. At the time, I mused that if we had
posted all the code and data for the project on github, there'd be no need for 
the FOI request. I was told that it was necessary to only give requesters exactly 
what they asked for. So we did. But.

# Why not make the code and data open? 

The only answer seems to be to maintain 
agency authority over the decision making process. If no one else has the 
information, then no one else can criticize or take over the decision. But this
is patently false. Ballot initiatives tie the hands of Agencies across the country. 
**Make a table of ballot initiatives**
These initiatives were not stopped by agencies keeping their data and analyses
secret. I don't know if having the data in the open would have stopped a ballot initiative
either, but it seems a reasonable hypothesis to try out. 

Keeping the data and analyses secret provides another advantage: it hides the tradeoffs
that decision makers are making. There are unavoidable tradeoffs in natural 
resources management. There is no way to make all stakeholders perfectly happy. 
If there were, then those decisions aren't going to be challenged. If an agency
simply tells stakeholders what the decision is, then perhaps some will be 
happy, some merely satisfied, and others outraged. But no one will be able to
tell the extent to which their concerns were traded away to advantage someone
else. 

# Reasons to make the data and code open

## Increase trust

The more trust stakeholders have in an agency, the more likely they are to accept 
a decision. **check for trust citations** Placing the code and data in the open
should increase trust, because look ma, nothing up either sleeve! But that only
works if it is also clear how the analyses contributed to the decision, and
ultimately that means exposing the tradeoffs involved. 

## Increase credibility

Scientists are used to building credibility by exposing their work to peer review
as part of the publishing process. But a lot of agency work doesn't get peer 
reviewed, because it isn't really pushing science forward. Putting the data and
code out in the open invites constructive criticism -- stakeholders can see 
what choices were made in the analysis. In fact, they can take the data and make
different choices and see if that affects the results. Making the work public
will also lead to better work -- no room to be sloppy and no carpet to hide
sketchy assumptions under. 

## Expose salience

The analysis should already be salient to the decision, because the work is done
to support the decision. But it might not be obvious to stakeholders how the work
is connected to the decision. Agencies might consider that a feature rather than 
a bug, but I think it is something that should be fixed.

## Increase legitimacy

I think of legitimacy of the analysis as the "3rd rail" of the science policy
interface -- touch it and your contribution is dead to the stakeholders. 

# Conclusion

I don't have rose-colored glasses on; radical openness won't make conflict with
stakeholders go away. But I think it could change the nature of that conflict for
the better.

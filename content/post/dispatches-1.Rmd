A couple weeks ago I realized that my low, but stable, state was in fact a nosedive.
Since then I pretty much cratered, crawled out, and maybe, just maybe, I'm back
on my feet again. 

I spent the week following my realization just waiting for something new to happen.
I refocused on a very small number of things that just had to get done. Each day, 
one thing. I've been very, very lucky to have the support of my boss. As a result of
that I've started handing off the organizing of the Ecology Lab for the fall. This
had to happen eventually, but my relapse into depression accelerated the pace a great deal. 

I also met with a friend to just ramble aimlessly for a bit. Just empathetic listening,
not trying to solve my problem, which at that point seemed insoluble.

I love that song, and that line captures a lot of how I felt last week. Still, having 
someone sit with me and just listen, magic. 

Last Monday I started Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, which is a refinement of
Electro-Convulsive Therapy. Basically, it stimulates the neurons in a specific 
brain region without the "Convulsive" part. TMS is well documented to help a large fraction 
of people with treatment resistant depression, although not everybody responds.
Daily treatments for about 6 weeks are required, and even after that, if it works,
"tune ups" are required every so often. But a friend tried it earlier this year,
and when I last spoke with them they were taking no medication at all. 

2 seconds of magnetic pulses every 20 
seconds for 20 minutes. It isn't very comfortable, and I leave the sessions with
a headache. The first day or two I felt pretty wide awake right afterward, although
the feeling didn't last past noon.

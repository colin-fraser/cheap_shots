A couple weeks ago I realized that my low, but stable, state was in fact a nosedive.
Since then I pretty much cratered, crawled out, and maybe, just maybe, I'm back
on my feet again. Trigger warning: I will discuss suicidal ideation below.

I spent the week following my realization just waiting for something new to happen.
I refocused on a very small number of things that just had to get done. Each day, 
one thing. I've been very, very lucky to have the support of my boss. As a result of
that I've started handing off the organizing of the Ecology Lab for the fall. This
had to happen eventually, but my relapse into depression accelerated the pace a great deal. 

I also met with a friend to just ramble aimlessly for a bit. Just empathetic listening,
not trying to solve my problem, which at that point seemed insoluble.

I love that song, and that line captures a lot of how I felt last week. Still, having 
someone sit with me and just listen, magic. 

Last Monday I started Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, which is a refinement of
Electro-Convulsive Therapy. Basically, it stimulates the neurons in a specific 
brain region without the "Convulsive" part. TMS is well documented to help a large fraction 
of people with treatment resistant depression, although not everybody responds.
Daily treatments for about 6 weeks are required, and even after that, if it works,
"tune ups" are required every so often. But a friend tried it earlier this year,
and when I last spoke with them they were taking no medication at all. 

2 seconds of magnetic pulses every 20 
seconds for 20 minutes. It isn't very comfortable, and I leave the sessions with
a headache. Most of the time I just breathe, eyes closed, counting breaths. It is
hard to have a conversation with the tech when every 18 seconds a woodpecker starts
hammering on your skull. The muscles in the right side of my jaw clench. Then it 
passes and I resume counting. 
The first day or two I felt pretty wide awake right afterward, although
the feeling didn't last past noon.

Last Wednesday I tried something completely different: acupuncture. I wouldn't 
have considered it at all, but I've known Lezlie Abbott at Nebraska Acupuncture for
a long time. So why not. I figure anything that's been around for millenia must
have some efficacy. Even if the underlying model of classical eastern medicine is
wrong, it might still make accurate predictions. Machine learning works, after all.

One of the things that impressed me the most about that first session was the level
of detail in Lezlie's observations. A western doctor takes your pulse, and records the
frequency. I don't know what Lezlie was looking for, but she took my pulse in both
wrists and recorded at least 12 different bits of information. She looked at my
tongue. She asked me how often I blow my nose -- often several times per hour -- and 
was surprised at that answer. After quizzing me
and recording a complete medical history, she loaded me up with needles. 

Most of the needles I couldn't feel going in. A few I felt for a moment, but 
after a second or two the sensation was gone. The two exceptions were one in my
right lower leg, and another in the side of my right wrist. Both generated an
achy sensation. Leslie wiggled (probably a technical term there) a few of the
needles around after inserting them. 
There were needles sticking out of me from head to toe. Then she 
left me alone for 20 minutes. I took the opportunity to practice mindfulness 
meditation. 

Pulling the needles out generated more feeling than putting them in, but quickly
gone. When I went to sit up on the table, I nearly couldn't do it -- like my abs
had been unplugged. I had to roll over on my side and get up gradually. I felt 
very relaxed. 

I wasn't looking for this change, but over the next couple of days it seemed like
my sinuses weren't draining as much as usual. Confirmation bias and all that, so
I've started recording my kleenex use. I'm going back for another acupuncture session
in two weeks, so I'll have a good baseline to compare.

Wednesday evening I hit the bottom of this cycle. I lay awake most of the night thinking
of suicide. Suicidal ideation (SI) isn't new to me, but normally I'm able to separate
the occurence of those thoughts from me, myself. The thought appears, flashes past,
and goes away. Now, that's still not good, but as my friend says it is like background radiation.
There, but not particularly harmful. Wednesday evening the SI went from background 
radiation to full-blown thinking.

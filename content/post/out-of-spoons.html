<p>Hey that rhymes!</p>
<p><a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">Spoon theory</a>
is a metaphor for how chronic illness, mental or physical, reduces the energy
available for everyday tasks. You start the day with a certain number of spoons.
Each thing you do costs a spoon. Maybe more. When you’re out of spoons that’s it,
you’re done for the day. A healthy person starts with lots of spoons, and usually
ends the day with spoons to spare.</p>
<p>If you’re chronically ill, say with arthritis, or depression, your spoon supply
is limited. In my case, it varies day by day. In the run up to fall semester,
my supply has dropped dangerously low. I hadn’t realized quite how low until
the end of a big college meeting this morning. I didn’t have to do anything
except sit there and clap at the appropriate moments. Our amazing Dean stopped me on my way
out to say thanks for the work I’ve been doing. I just about broke into tears
right there in the auditorium. That was … unexpected, to say the least. I
managed to grind out a thank you for the compliment, and held on until I made it
out to the car.</p>
<p>I was done for today. Nonetheless I made it to my counseling appointment. Now I’m
in negative spoon territory. This isn’t part of the original metaphor, but helps
explain why I have the strength to get through some days. I borrow spoons against
tomorrow’s supply. Trouble is, borrowed spoons come with a ridiculously high interest
rate.</p>

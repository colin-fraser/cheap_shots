And why did she leave her nest to do it? TL;DR: She wouldn't, or at least, not
for long. 

We investigated nest-attendance patterns of 25 female Prairie-
Chickens in the Nebraska Sandhills, USA, to identify the proximate
cues that they use to make behavioral decisions with respect
to incubation. We used iButtons to measure changes in nest temperature every
4 minutes; this allowed us to measure the duration of on-bouts (hen sitting on 
nest) and off-bouts (hen off the nest). 

Three of our hypotheses
are the following: if incubating female Prairie-Chickens
prioritize nest success, then (i) we expect them to reduce the
duration of incubation off-bouts when ambient temperatures are
unfavorable for embryonic development (high or low temperatures);
(ii) we expect them to initiate incubation off-bouts at times
of day when ambient temperatures are favorable for continued
embryonic development; (iii) we expect them to show increased incubation
off-bout duration at nests with greater vegetation cover
and (or) at greater distances from roads because of lower risk of
predation in these conditions.

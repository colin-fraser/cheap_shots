<p>Monday’s number of new cases in the USA are inside the prediction interval, but are still below expectations.
Good news! However, new cases per day in the USA grew about 25%
faster than new cases in Italy over the first 12 days of the outbreak in each country.
Italy’s numbers are showing clear signs of a slowdown relative to
exponential growth.</p>

treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.</p>

<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r_iv/">Much as yesterday</a>, Monday’s new cases are inside the prediction intervals but
below expectations for the exponential model<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think there is a “weekend effect” reducing reporting (<a href="/post/covid-19_and_R_part_iv/">see Sunday’s post</a>
for the full hypothesis). Monday’s point is just as low as the previous Saturday and Sunday.
The points are below expectations, but tracking along pretty parallel. This
means that the <strong>rate</strong> of new cases hasn’t changed, but my estimate of the initial number
of cases might be high. There is another possibility, but it’s a bit technical. My model
assumes the deviations of the observations from the expected value are
independent of each other. That is, the fact that Sunday’s observation is below the
expected line doesn’t change the distribution of Monday’s observation. But
this is probably not true. Both Sunday and Monday’s observations are coming from the
same population of true (but unknown) cases. So if my model is overestimating one it is
likely to overestimate the next one as well.</p>
<p>Below I fit the same model to case data from Italy, where the outbreak started a week or
so sooner than in the USA. The number of new cases per day grew 25% <em>faster</em>
in the USA than in Italy over the first 12 days of the outbreak in each country.
That’s not such good news for the USA. The pandemic response in the USA is so fragmented and
disorganized that it is hard to tell whether we took action earlier in the outbreak process than
Italy did. Time will tell.</p>
<p>How long before we see effects of social distancing?<br />
The effects of social distancing won’t be apparent for 5 or more days, because new cases
today are people that got sick up to 2 weeks ago.
In the meantime, if we start testing more frequently, the number
of new cases per day might go UP!</p>
<p>We currently have 18 cases in Nebraska. They got sick anywhere up to two weeks ago.
We also know that only 20% of people get sick enough to go to hospital or the doctor,
and only really sick people are being tested anyway. So on average, a week ago there
could have been 18 / 0.2 = 90 cases in Nebraska. Obviously this is a very crude
calculation, but the point is that we’re not seeing the full extent of the pandemic,
just the tip of the iceberg. And just like an iceberg, what’s below the water line
causes the problem.</p>
<p>Bottom line – the pandemic still spreading in USA consistent with exponential growth.
The next 5-10 days will be critical to seeing
what sort of trajectory the USA is on.</p>

<p>This is a new section where I break down the steps of one of the figures or analyses
elsewhere on the page. I’ll post the code here, but in the interest of saving space and
typing, I’m going to walk through the code and make a video. I’ll try to keep those short by
just focusing on one piece of code at a time. If you’re new to R/RStudio, <a href="https://drewtyre.rbind.io/classes/computer-setup/">I’ve got videos and
instructions on how to set things up</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s topic: making the figure above showing the number of cases and fitting a model. The USA
is complicated, so I’m going to use a different country, say … mmm, Italy. Links to videos and
some additional commentary below the figure.</p>

<p>The code above is slightly tweaked relative to what I used in the video; I’ve
adjusted the date range to match the USA analysis better, and the filename is
slightly different. I also added lables and copyright yada. But the steps and
interpretation are the same.</p>

<p>Videos are way too long! But what else are you doing while social distancing? Learn some new stuff!
I think two points are worth making about that figure. First, just like with the USA figure
there are signs the number of new cases per day is slowing because the points are all
falling below the expected line, and some are outside the 95% prediction interval. That’s great
news for Italy. The estimated growth rate for italy is 0.12 compared to 0.15 for the USA over a
similar 12 day span following the first day of sustained growth. So in the first 12 days of the
outbreak the number of new cases per day was growing about 25% <em>faster</em> in the USA than in Italy.
That’s not such good news.</p>

<p>Warning, not for the faint of heart. I’m basically typing while thinking, so if you’re looking for a nice
coherent story beyond here, stop reading now.</p>
<p>I’ve got so many things to try, I’m losing track! My friend Scott is waiting on predictions
of the cumulative cases from a logistic
model, so lets do that with the cumulative data for the 6 countries. The logistic model
has one more parameter than the exponential model, and levels off to an asymptote. This
is what we expect for the cumulative number of cases, because as more and more people recover
from the virus (or get vaccinated) the number of people left to infect gets lower, and
the epidemic ends. The estimate of the Asymptote parameter in these models would give us
an idea of how many people might ultimately be infected. I’m skeptical that these models will
work, because early in the epidemic process the data have little information about where the
asymptote is. But let’s try and see what happens.</p>

<p>That was way harder than I planned on. The goto function for non-linear models like this is <code>nls()</code>, but the estimation algorithms available there were struggling to find converged
parameters. Package <code>drc</code> (dose response curve) gave me good results before so I tried that.
Those models converged, but then I ran into all sorts of problems trying to get the predicted
values out of them. <code>drc</code> isn’t tidy-friendly, returning matrices and failing left and right
if you feed it a tibble. A few hours of hair-pulling later, I’ve got the fitted models and
predicted values. My first impression is that the confidence and prediction intervals are
way too narrow – I just don’t believe them.</p>
<p>But that’s not the reason to discard these models – with the exception of the USA, all
five sets of observed cumulative cases are <em>above</em> the prediction interval. This is
especially obvious with Iran. The best fit parameters have the curves tipping over towards
the asymptote too soon. Within the data used to fit the models seem to be matching pretty well,
except for Australia. What about the estimated asymptotic sizes?</p>

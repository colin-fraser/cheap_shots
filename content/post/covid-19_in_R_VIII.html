<p>New cases in the USA took a big jump up yesterday. Italy continues to add more cases per day
than 20 times their ICU capacity. US states and Canadian provinces with the largest number
of cases so far are seeing new cases per day consistent with the exponential model.</p>
<p>That outcome is not set in stone. The time to act is now. Even a one day delay in reducing transmission rate
dramatically increases the peak number of sick people. If you’re lucky to be
in a low risk group, you can still spread the virus. Although your symptoms are mild,
the person you hand the virus off to could experience much worse symptoms. You don’t
have to hermetically seal your house. I like this graphic:

<h1>The bottom line</h1>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.</p>
<p>The figure below is complex, so I’ll highlight some
features first. The y axis is now cases / 100,000 population to make it easier to compare Italy
and the USA. As before, the BLUE LINES are exponential growth models that assume
the rate of increase is <em>constant</em>. The dashed black lines are predictions from that
model. To make comparison easier, the estimated model and predictions for both countries are on both panels.
The lines and intervals for the other country are faded out. The RED LINES
are 20 times the number of ICU beds per 100,000 population in each country. Note that
the y axis is logarithmic.</p>

<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r_vii/">Unlike yesterday</a>, new cases in the USA took a big jump up, but are still inside the prediction interval<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That jump up has multiple alternative explanations besides an increase in the
actual number of cases. Yesterday’s number was low, so it could be that reporting glitches delayed some
cases from wednesday to thursday. The USA is also trying to increase the rate of testing, with varying levels
of success, so if testing has started to step up the number of reported cases could rise just due to that. Or
both of those things could be happening, on top of an increase in the number of true cases.</p>
<p>Bit of perspective on the testing issue – <a href="https://apple.news/AU6X4O-5WT3G6JGsqcOet8Q">apparently California tested 17000 people so far, but 10000 of those
tests are still pending</a>!</p>
<p>Italy’s numbers continue the linear pattern that started around March 12 – they are going along at a constant
level, a flat line on this graph. Each day Italy adds about the same number of cases as
the day before. Unfortunately that is still more cases per day than their health care infrastructure can
handle. To put those numbers in perspective, the thin white line just above the latest point from italy is
1000 cases / 100,000 population. That’s 1%. New cases in Italy are nearly 1% of the population <em>per day</em>.</p>
<p>Below are the same calculations but focused in on 3 US states and 3 Canadian provinces<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Each panel has the same features as the graph above.</p>
<p><img src="/post/covid-19_in_R_VIII_files/figure-html/featured_image-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Washington, New York, and British Columbia are near or over the estimated per capita supply of ICU beds. The
projections are two weeks past the end of the window I used to fit the models; those forecasts indicate that
all six locales could be in trouble by the end of the month. If efforts to reduce transmission came too late,
New York could be seeing 10000 cases per day by the end of the month.</p>
<p>A prominent quantitative ecologist (who can remain nameless) dismissed my efforts here because the
exponential model magnifies the uncertainty making forecasts useless, and making it impossible to refute the
exponential model. In addition, many models can be
consistent with exponential growth at the beginning,
but do a lousy job of forecasting (for example, <a href="/post/covid-19_and_R_v/">the logistic model</a> scroll down).
It’s true that the forecasts here have a large amount of uncertainty – the forecast incident cases in
Ontario for March 30 span 3 orders of magnitude, between 100 and 10000 new cases.
However that is the worst case, caused by the
large day to day fluctuations in reported cases in Ontario. In addition, there is no guarantee that
the exponential model appears to work just because of this uncertainty. Look at the plot for Italy.
It was clear on March 13 that the exponential model was no longer valid in Italy. Honestly, I’ve
been hoping the exponential model would become invalid in the USA and Canada. That would indicate
that efforts to reduce transmission were working. But there is no sign of that yet.</p>

<div id="whats-next" class="section level1">
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>I think this will be my last post for a while. I’ve learned a ton, but trying to keep on top
of the scientific literature and news posts, and hours of hard thinking about code each day is wearing me
out. There are huge well-funded teams<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> crunching the numbers and advising decision makers, so
nothing lost by me taking a break. Here are my lessons learned</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simple models can be useful for decision making. If I’d thought to do it, I could have predicted the
ICU crunch in New York 2 weeks ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Data are critical. The biggest weakness for the US predictions is the lack of testing to identify cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Crowdsourcing can work! The JHU data aggregation is now the de facto go to for everyone, even the US government<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone wants an up to date figure for some state/province/country shoot me an email and I’ll see what
I can do. Stay safe everyone, wash your hands, go for a walk.</p>

<p>New cases in the USA took a big jump up yesterday. Italy continues to add more cases per day
than 20 times their ICU capacity.</p>
<p>That outcome is not set in stone. The time to act is now. Even a one day delay in reducing transmission rate
dramatically increases the peak number of sick people. If you’re lucky to be
in a low risk group, you can still spread the virus. Although your symptoms are mild,
the person you hand the virus off to could experience much worse symptoms. You don’t
have to hermetically seal your house. I like this graphic:

<h1>The bottom line</h1>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.</p>
<p>The figure below is complex, so I’ll highlight some
features first. The y axis is now cases / 100,000 population to make it easier to compare Italy
and the USA. As before, the BLUE LINES are exponential growth models that assume
the rate of increase is <em>constant</em>. The dashed black lines are predictions from that
model. To make comparison easier, the estimated model and predictions for both countries are on both panels.
The lines and intervals for the other country are faded out. The RED LINES
are 20 times the number of ICU beds per 100,000 population in each country. Note that
the y axis is logarithmic.</p>

<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r_vii/">Unlike yesterday</a>, new cases in the USA took a big jump up, but are still inside the prediction interval<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Italy’s numbers continue the linear pattern that started around March 12 – they are going along at a constant
level, a flat line on this graph. Each day Italy adds about the same number of cases as
the day before. Unfortunately that is still more cases per day than their health care infrastructure can
handle.</p>
<p>Below are the same calculations but focused in on 3 US states and 3 Canadian provinces<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Each panel has the same features as the graph above.</p>

<h1>Full data nerd past here</h1>
<p>Remember – coding while thinking, no coherent story, ymmv.</p>

<div id="whats-next" class="section level1">
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>So tomorrow I should be able to fiddle the state/province graphs a bit more
and get localized predictions for when ICU capacity might become a problem. I guess
it’s getting time to find an alternative model to the exponential as well. The
logistic curves from a few days ago were terrible at forecasting, so not sure
what else to try. Suggestions in the comments please!</p>
<p>I’d also like to refine the prediction of ICU capacity. <a href="https://medium.com/@megan.higgie/without-serious-action-australia-will-run-out-of-intensive-care-beds-between-7-and-10-april-59f83b52756e">I finally found someone
making predictions that include confidence limits</a> and Dr. Higgie predicts the time at which Australia
will start to experience issues with ICU capacity (early April). She makes a great point that
cases occupy an ICU bed for some weeks, so just looking at the new cases is optimistic. Instead
there needs to be a kind of sliding window sum of the new cases.</p>

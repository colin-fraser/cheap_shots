<p>Yesterday I got into <a href="/post/covid-19_in_R/">the COVID-19 forecasting business</a>.
Today I want to see how my predictions held up.</p>
<div id="munging-the-data-again" class="section level1">
<h1>Munging the data … again</h1>
<p>My least favorite part of data analysis is munging the data into a usable form.
Especially #otherpeoplesdata. John Hopkins University is doing a great service
making their data under their COVID-19 dashboard open, but they’ve made some
interesting choices. I can only assume these choices work well for what they are
doing; certainly isn’t making my work easier! From the issues posted on github
sounds like the JHU team might be getting overwhelmed. So I’m going to try
the data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data">Our World In Data</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
library(&quot;lubridate&quot;)
owid_url &lt;- &quot;https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/total_cases.csv&quot;

owid_wide &lt;- read_csv(owid_url) # just grab it once 

us_confirmed_total &lt;- owid_wide %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(-1, 
               names_to = &quot;country&quot;, values_to = &quot;cumulative_cases&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(country == &quot;United States&quot;) %&gt;% 
  arrange(date)  



p1 &lt;- ggplot(data = us_confirmed_total,
       mapping = aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(y = cumulative_cases)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = cumulative_cases))  
p1</code></pre>

<p>Well, fooey. <a href="">CDC reports over 1600 cases</a> for March 13. The
<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">WorldOMeter</a> reports
over 2000! So I’m not sure what to do at this point. I’m pretty sure my predictions
from yesterday are at least in the ballpark. If I find a good way to keep on
top of the numbers I’ll circle back to this. But for now … GIGO.</p>

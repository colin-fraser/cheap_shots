<p>I now regularly test models using cross validation. I use a “calibration curve” to see whether the predictions from independent data fit the observed data. What I don’t have is a good citation for why this should be so. It’s a bit like asking for a citation for breathing. <em>Of course</em>, the expected values are <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 1\)</span>!</p>
<p>But, I need to find a citation. In my brief search so far I found David Cox <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/cox/cox49.pdf">(1958)</a> wrote about this hypothesis for a binary regression model. That wasn’t in the context of cross validation however. A brief look at Web of Science indicates that papers in clinical sciences are still citing it when they test models, so maybe that’s good enough?</p>
<p>Are there any other ideas out there?</p>

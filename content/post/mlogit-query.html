<p>I received the following email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a junior faculty member familiarizing myself with the mlogit package in R. After several hours researching an issue, the most helpful information gathered comes from a <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51148/unable-to-provide-random-parameter-with-mlogit/121122#121122">response of yours provided on SE</a>. I was hoping you might provide some further insight.
I have a data set in which individuals belong to one of 4 groups (A, B, C, D) and repeatedly choose between three outcomes (X, Y, Z), with the number of trials varying by individual. I am interested in the fixed effect of group, but wish to account for the repeated observations across individuals. In turn, I would like to conduct a mixed mulitnomial logistic with personID as a random effect.
I’ve successfully implemented mlogit.data() to shape the data in long form (with columns personID, group, and choice). But I’m struggling with the following syntax concerns for mlogit():
1) Covariates used with the rpar argument must be alternative specific. To confirm: is the rpar argument even needed in my scenario? Or is the random effect of individual already accounted for by if within mlogit.data, ind.var = personID?
2) For random effects in linear regressions (via lme4), the predictor goes behind the bar (e.g., |personID). Am I reading the mlogit documentation correctly in assuming the opposite for mlogit (i.e., my intended fixed effect of group goes behind the bar)?</p>

<p>Someone read one of my answers! woohoo! Unfortunately my knowledge of <code>mlogit()</code>
is actually very limited. I answered a couple questions on CrossValidated when I
was trying to figure out a multinomial logit model myself, but haven’t used it
since. But I’m a sucker for a puzzle, so let’s see what I can remember.</p>
<p>I always work better with a working example, so I’m going to try and make one that
matches the structure of this problem. The mixed logit exercise in the vignettes
has panel data with multiple choices per person. The inidividual level parameters
are all continuous, so I’ll turn one into a</p>

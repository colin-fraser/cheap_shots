<p>Over the past few weeks outbreaks centered around meat processing facilities hit the news. I started
wondering how these would impact Nebraska’s numbers. I break down Nebraska’s numbers by county here
to see what is working and where we should be frankly alarmed. TL;DR: too early to open up
Lancaster county according to whitehouse guidelines.</p>
<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r/">The first post in this series was March 13</a>, in case you’re just joining and
want to see the progression. I’m now posting the bottom line figures for each <a href="/post/covid19-bottom-line-usa/">state</a> and <a href="/post/covid19-bottom-line-canada/">province</a> on
the same post that just gets updated each day.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For this analysis I’m going to the NY Times dataset directly, which has data for the USA broken
down by county. I’m also testing out a data package I contributed to – <code>wnvdata</code><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> –
has county level census
data so I can calculate per capita case rates.</p>

<p>Looks like this data is including some of the initial cases from the Diamond Princess
that were flown to UNMC, because I’m pretty sure there were no local cases in February.</p>
<p>So lets give these the Tyre Treatment. I’ll start the models on the day each county hit
20 cases, and only look at 6 counties that are interesting. The y axes are Active
or Recovered cases per 100,000 population, so
these curves can be directly compared despite the huge variation in the number of people in
each county. I’ve put the actual dates on the x-axes, but let them shift, so all the x axes
start on different days.</p>

<p>There are quite a few things to see here! First, the bump upwards in cases for
the entire state that I attributed to an increase in testing just at the end of March happened entirely
in Douglas county (part of Omaha, for non-Nebraskans), as far as I can tell.
Douglas county also had clear signs
of transmission reduction, with the points after April 8 flattening off relative
to the exponential growth rate estimated from the first two weeks. Sarpy county
is also part of Omaha and also showed signs of flattening. However, by the 3rd week of April
both counties resumed accelerating at the early pace.</p>
<p>Lincoln is in Lancaster county, and we clearly are not flattening the curve.
In fact the doubling time will have decreased relative to the early number of 11 days.
Douglas and Sarply counties also had long doubling times early. One possible
reason is that urban Nebraskans had already started social distancing before the 20th
case was reported. Another possibility is that even in Nebraska’s urban centers
we are not as dense. <cough> I mean that in the population density sense! This
hypothesis is more consistent with the observation that doubling time is &gt; 10 days in
Douglas county where the outbreak started a month sooner. I can’t remember if
people were discussing social distancing in the first week of March.</p>
<p>And then there are Dakota, Hall, and Dawson counties, all with early doubling times less
than four days.
All three broke through 1000 cases per 100,000 people (1% incidence). All three have clearly
flattened off, indicating that the outbreaks there are more under control.</p>
<p>That’s encouraging. However, we are about to “open up” the state, and our cases in urban
counties are still accelerating. The <a href="https://rt.live">state as a whole</a> has not hit
<span class="math inline">\(R_t &lt; 1\)</span> (at least as of May 11). The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/">guidelines for opening up</a> suggest
“a downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14 day period”. There are other
possible criteria, but this one we can check with the data in hand. The observation
on May 10 is quite an outlier with outsized effect on the model, so we’ll slide back one day.</p>

<p>The slope estimate is positive, an average of 2.4 more cases per day over the past 14 days.
This is a statistically significant result, albeit barely. However, there is arguably no
evidence of a decrease in cases over the past 14 days.
So, at least by this criterion, there is NO WAY we should be re-opening Lancaster county yet.</p>

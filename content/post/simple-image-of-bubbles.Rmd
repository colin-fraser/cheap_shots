![This is the goal.](/post/simple-image-of-bubbles_files/figure-html/example.png)

I started out thinking "simple plot" meant "base graphics", given that I think my colleague isn't in the tidyverse yet. But even trying to think of how I would do it in base graphics, I realized I was thinking about it from a tidy, that is, data driven, perspective. So, tough. I'm going to do it in ggplot2. The first trick is to get the data organized. 

```{r organizeData, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # yeah I know, loads too much stuff. but so handy!
grasscover <- tribble(
  ~year, ~row, ~col, ~grass,
  2012, 1, 2, 25,
  2012, 2, 1, 5,
  2012, 3, 2, 100,
  2012, 3, 3, 15,
  2012, 4, 1, 15,
  2013, 1, 2, 10,
  2013, 3, 2, 25,
  2013, 4, 1, 25
)
```

Now the first cut is straightforward.

```{r}
bubbles <- ggplot(data = grasscover,
                  mapping = aes(x = col, y = row)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = grass), color = "blue") + 
  facet_wrap(~year)
bubbles
```

That's most of the way there, but a few cosmetic things remain. This means delving into ggplot themes.

```{r}
bubbles + theme_minimal()
```

That didn't do everything I wanted, but it's an OK starting place. I need to eliminate the axis labels, tick labels, shift the gridlines to inbetween the points, and re-scale the bubbles so the biggest one is ~ 1 in diameter. And put back the plot outline. I'm not ashamed to say that my next move was to use Google. And that led me to my favorite site [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Axes_(ggplot2)/).

```{r}
bubbles + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 1, color="black"),
        panel.spacing = unit(1, "cm"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, size = 1),
        legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0.5,3.5,1), limits=c(0.5,3.5), expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0.5, 4.5, 1), limits = c(0.5,4.5), expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_size_area(max_size = 24, name = "% Grass Cover")
```

Pretty good! And, as a bonus I get a properly scaled legend. The one non-intuitive bit that involved some head scratching is the argument expand `scale_x_continuous(..., expand = c(0,0))`. That removed the extra space around the axes -- the default `c(0.05, 0)` expands the plot area by 5% compared to the limits.

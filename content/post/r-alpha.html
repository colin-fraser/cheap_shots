<p>A few weeks ago I rambled on about <a href="https://drewtyre.rbind.io/posts/below-K/">carrying capacity as a concept</a>.
The day after I posted that, I stumbled across <a href="https://mallet.oeb.harvard.edu/files/malletlab/files/mallet_the_struggle_2012.pdf">a paper by James Mallet in 2012</a>
on why the r-K parameterization of the logistic model is all wrong. Mind Blown.</p>
<p>The essential point of the paper is that our typical form of logistic growth</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{max}\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>is a historical accident. Verhulst’s original form was</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{dt} = r_{max} - \alpha N
\]</span></p>
<p>with an equilibrium population size given by <span class="math inline">\(N^* = r_{max} / \alpha\)</span>. This is brilliant,
because now <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> represents growth in the absence of intraspecific competition,
while <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is how much growth is reduced by intraspecific competition. Most
importantly, <em>these two parameters can vary independently</em>. In contrast, <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are linked at the hip.</p>
<p>To see this, consider the following diagram of per-capita birth and death rates changing with
population size<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/r-alpha_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A change in per capita death rates, say by increasing trapping by humans that is
density independent, shifts the death rate curve upwards, parallel to the current
line. This reduces <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span>, because the y-intercepts get closer, <em>and reduces <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span></em>,
because now the two curves cross closer to the origin. However, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the sum
of the slopes of the lines <em>does not change</em>.</p>
<p>This isn’t a trivial side bar. Trevor Hefley’s <a href="https://rdcu.be/bnuBG">work on detecting transcritical bifurcations
in real populations</a> ran into issues because of this non-independence.
Trevor fit an r-K model to population data on Bobwhite. He allowed both <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to
change over time. If <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> dips below 0 while <span class="math inline">\(K &gt; 0\)</span>, then the population
goes through a “transcritical bifurcation” – the equilibrium population size ceases
to exist, and the population decays exponentially towards 0. However, if <span class="math inline">\(N&gt;K\)</span> when
the bifurcation occurs, the r-K model predicts an increase towards <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>

<p>Needless to say that isn’t the expected behavior for <span class="math inline">\(r_{max} &lt; 0\)</span>! If I switch
to the <span class="math inline">\(r-\alpha\)</span> form, I need to work out what <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> should be to have <span class="math inline">\(N^* = 100\)</span>.
I think it is <span class="math inline">\(r/N^* = 0.005\)</span> in this case so</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ramod &lt;- function(N0, r, alpha){
  N1 &lt;- N0 + N0*r - alpha*N0^2
  return(N1)
}
inputs &lt;- tibble(t = 1:20,
                 r = c(rep(0.5,10), rep(-0.1,10)),
                 alpha = 0.005,
                 K = r / alpha)
outputs &lt;- iterate(inputs, N0 = 20, rKmod)
ggplot(data = outputs,
       mapping = aes(x = t, y = N)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_step(data = inputs,
            mapping = aes(y = K), linetype = 2) + 
  ylim(c(0,100))</code></pre>

<p>That’s more like it! The per capita effect of intra-specific competition didn’t change –
the perturbation just affected the population in a density independent way.</p>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>? I’ll start with discrete time exponential growth, and substitute
straight line functions for the per capita birth and death rates.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
N_{t+1} &amp; =N_t\left(1 + b - d\right) \\
        &amp; =N_t + N_tb - N_td \\
        &amp; =N_t + N_t(b_0 + b_1N_t) - N_t(d_0 + d_1N_t) \\
        &amp; =N_t + N_t(b_0 - d_0) + N_t^2(b_1 - d_1) \\
        &amp; =N_t + r_{max}N_t -\alpha N_t^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\(b_0-d_0\)</span> is usually rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span>. But also, <span class="math inline">\(-\alpha = b_1 - d_1\)</span>,
which is … just beautiful. To write that equation with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> requires so much more
algebra.</p>
<p>It also expands easily to competition.
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
N_{1,t+1} &amp; =N_{1,t} + r_{max}N_{1,t} -\alpha_{11} N_{1,t}^2 - \alpha_{21}N_{1,t}N_{2,t} \\
N_{2,t+1} &amp; =N_{2,t} + r_{max}N_{2,t} -\alpha_{22} N_{2,t}^2 - \alpha_{12}N_{2,t}N_{1,t}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and so on! Wow.</p>
<p>Now I’ve even more reason to rewrite my lecture notes and redo all the videos. How do I check to see if
this change improves student learning?</p>

A screenshot of a plot from Fox News went somewhat viral among some segments of society. The
y-axis is funky, apparently changing scales part way through. There was some debate about the 
plot, was Fox News trying to lie about the curve flattening? Or are their graphics people just
incompetent?

[The first post in this series was March 13](/post/covid-19_and_r/), in case you're just joining and
want to see the progression. I'm now posting the bottom line figures for each [state](/post/covid19-bottom-line-usa/) and [province](/post/covid19-bottom-line-canada/) on
the same post that just gets updated each day.

DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time, 
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.[^1] 

This is the plot in question, if you haven't seen it. Pay close attention to the top
of the y axis -- the interval between the gridlines changes from 30 to 50. This reduces
the perceived slope of the data from March 26.

Visual inspection of my data suggested that this was Colorado. Rebuild the plot.

           caption = paste("Source data: https://coviddata.github.io/coviddata/ downloaded ",
                           format(file.mtime(savefilename), usetz = TRUE),
                           "\n Unofficial, not peer reviewed results.",
                           "\n Copyright Andrew Tyre 2020. Distributed with MIT License.")) +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.title = element_blank())

  
```

Incident cases should be linear if cumulative cases are growing
exponentially, so by eye the original plot is still suggestive of
exponential growth. I can't see where they are getting their
total cases from -- if I add up the data in their plot or even the NYT 
data through April 1 I get smaller numbers. NYT numbers are not much 
smaller, could be there were some cases prior to March 10 that my 
data source isn't picking up anymore. 

One suggestion was that the axes were merely mislabeled. Let's call 
this the "incompetent" hypothesis. Alternatively, Fox was trying
to reduce the apparent slope of points after March 25. Let's call that
the "devious" hypothesis. So now I'll try to force `ggplot()` to do both 
of those things ... 

```{r featured_image}
incompetent <- ggplot(data = fox_data) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Date, y = cases), size = 2, color="white") +
  geom_label(mapping = aes(x = Date, y = cases, label = cases)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30,400,30), labels = c(30, 60, 90, 100, 130, 160, 190, 240, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450))+
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 day", date_labels = "%B\n%d")+
     labs(y = "New Cases per day", 
           title = "New cases per day by Fox News",
          subtitle = "Y axis is mislabeled to match Fox News original plot",
           x = "Date",
           caption = paste("Source data: Fox News Plot",
                           "\n Unofficial, not peer reviewed results.",
                           "\n Copyright Andrew Tyre 2020. Distributed with MIT License.")) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "darkblue"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "darkblue"),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "white"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "white"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        )
incompetent
```

OK, I think that rules out the incompetent hypothesis -- the points don't match the mislabeled 
axes at all. They do match up on the original plot. For example, March 26 is just below the line labeled 
350, while if the axes are merely mislabeled that point is above the 350 line.

I was going to try to make a "devious" plot, but I can't figure out how! Initially I thought there
was only one break in the axis, but there are several. I might be able to reproduce it by using a 
discrete axis, and then bumping points up or down to match? Regardless, this degree of 
messing up has to be deliberate.

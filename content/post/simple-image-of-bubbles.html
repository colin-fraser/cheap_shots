<p>Hi Drew,</p>

<p>I’m trying to make a really simple (I think) plot in R, but am not sure how to do it. I want to make the attached, where the size of each “bubble” in each grid location depends on a single raw data point (% cover of a type of grass). Can you point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>I started out thinking “simple plot” meant “base graphics”, given that I think my colleague isn’t in the tidyverse yet. But even trying to think of how I would do it in base graphics, I realized I was thinking about it from a tidy, that is, data driven, perspective. So, tough. I’m going to do it in ggplot2. The first trick is to get the data organized.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse) # yeah I know, loads too much stuff. but so handy!
grasscover &lt;- tribble(
  ~year, ~row, ~col, ~grass,
  2012, 1, 2, 25,
  2012, 2, 1, 5,
  2012, 3, 2, 100,
  2012, 3, 3, 15,
  2012, 4, 1, 15,
  2013, 1, 2, 10,
  2013, 3, 2, 25,
  2013, 4, 1, 25
)</code></pre>
<p>Now the first cut is straightforward.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bubbles &lt;- ggplot(data = grasscover,
                  mapping = aes(x = col, y = row)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = grass), color = &quot;blue&quot;) + 
  facet_wrap(~year)
bubbles</code></pre>

<p>That’s most of the way there, but a few cosmetic things remain. This means delving into ggplot themes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bubbles + theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/simple-image-of-bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>That didn’t do everything I wanted, but it’s an OK starting place. I need to eliminate the axis labels, tick labels, shift the gridlines to inbetween the points, and re-scale the bubbles so the biggest one is ~ 1 in diameter. And put back the plot outline. I’m not ashamed to say that my next move was to use Google. And that led me to my favorite site <a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Axes_(ggplot2)/">Cookbook for R</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bubbles + theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 1, color=&quot;black&quot;),
        panel.spacing = unit(1, &quot;cm&quot;),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, size = 1),
        legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0.5,3.5,1), limits=c(0.5,3.5), expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0.5, 4.5, 1), limits = c(0.5,4.5), expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_size_area(max_size = 24, name = &quot;% Grass Cover&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/simple-image-of-bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Pretty good! And, as a bonus I get a properly scaled legend. The one non-intuitive bit that involved some head scratching is the argument expand <code>scale_x_continuous(..., expand = c(0,0))</code>. That removed the extra space around the axes – the default <code>c(0.05, 0)</code> expands the plot area by 5% compared to the limits.</p>

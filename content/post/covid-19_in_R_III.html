<p>In today’s post I want to summarize some information about what to do (and what not to do)
in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how my predictions are holding up.
I feel a little bit guilty because the topic is serious, and this data reflects
real suffering, but I am learning a lot with this real-time forecasting. In my
normal work I only get one data point <em>per year</em>. Which means building up skill
in forecasting takes a loooong time.</p>
<p>I’ve also realized I have a few different possible audiences with different needs.
There are intelligent and interested people like my mother who want the bottom line
explained but don’t care how I get there. There are students who want to learn
more about how to use R. And then there are some serious data nerds who want to
know about my every choice in the analysis and ask why I’m not doing y or z. So
I’m going to put the bottom line at the top, so that my mother doesn’t have to
scroll too far on her tablet (seriously, this was a conversation we just had).
So if you want the gory details scroll down.</p>

<h1>The bottom line</h1>

<p>Saturday’s count of new cases in the USA was within my prediction interval.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The prediction interval is the wider ribbon of grey around
the dashed line. For any one day, if you imagine 100 different
copies of reality, 95 of the 100 would have new cases that fall
inside the grey ribbon. So this prediction is still
looking good for my model. However, I would also
expect that the points would fluctuate above and below
the dashed line. I’m assuming that the rate of
new cases per case is not changing. If the “social distancing”
is working to reduce the spread, then the number of new cases
should start to drop away from my prediction. This is sort of
what is shown in the figure, but not severe enough yet
to make me throw out my simple model.</p>

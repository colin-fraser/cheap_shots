<p>Last week we saw a black hole for the first time! WOOHOOO!
So why are we (ecologists) moping around comparing ourselves unfavorably
with Dr. Katie Bouman?</p>
Like these,

<p>and lots of others, including many non-ecologists. I could add</p>
<p>Me, 50: struggling to teach exponential growth to undergraduates.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I absolutely believe Dr. Bouman did a great thing.
Yes, she was part of a team too, and that’s a great thing. But
we ecologists work in teams too, and our stuff is, well,
as the tweets say, sometimes a bit pathetic by comparison. But.</p>
<p>Just one of the 8 radio telescopes in the <a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/">Event Horizon Telescope</a>,
the <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/">Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillmeter Array</a>,
has <a href="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsf.gov%2Fabout%2Fbudget%2Ffy2019%2Fpdf%2F40s_fy2019.pdf">an annual operating budget from NSF of greater than $US40 million</a>!
For perspective, the entire NSF Division of Environmental Biology 2019 budget request is $US146 million.</p>
<p>Imagine what a team of ecologists could do with $40 million per year.
I think I could build a continental scale network of camera traps that
monitor the abundance of everything bigger than a cottontail, and in a
few years I would have really smashing predictions of how many
deer there will be next year anywhere in the country. You
could run a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/neon/index.jsp">National Ecological Observatory Network</a>.
Imagine asking a question that integrated the output of 8 NEONs
from around the globe. That. would. be. cool.</p>
<p>So. Stop beating yourselves up and compare apples with apples. We do
great science of huge importance to the planet, usually on a
shoestring budget. Sometimes our outputs are a bit, uh, coarse.
That’s OK.</p>

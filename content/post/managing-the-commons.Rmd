Elinor Ostrom won a nobel prize in economics for
describing the conditions under which groups exploiting natural resources can self govern without
top-down regulation. She formulated 8 design principles to follow. 

## Clearly defined boundaries

Boundaries refer not only to spatial boundaries, but also to who is in the 
group and who is out of the group. Wildlife management in the USA usually 
has clear spatial boundaries. Who is in the group is not as clearly defined.
On the one hand, the group of people who purchase licenses or permits to
harvest wildlife seems clear enough. But even membership in that group
fluctuates rapidly from year to year. I bought a Nebraska fishing license in 
2017, but not in 2018 or 2019 (yet!). Furthermore, according to law all
the taxpayers of a state collectively "own" the fish and wildlife living 
in the state (the public trust doctrine). For many large and charismatic 
species (e.g. mountain lions), groups outside of a state may express strong
opinions about management. However, a large proportion of those "with standing"
are completely unaware or disengaged with wildlife management.


## Proportional equivalence between benefits and costs

The idea behind this principle is that obtaining benefits carries some cost. 
For consumptive users of fish and wildlife this is true. Excise taxes on firearms, 
ammunition, and fishing equipment support fish and wildlife management directly. 
In addition, a license or permit must be purchased, which varies in
cost according to the magnitude of the benefit. 

However, there is little cost to non-consumptive users for extracting their
benefits, which include viewing opportunities and existence value of game species. 
From the perspective of consumptive users, these benefits are appropriated and
not fairly obtained. 

Non-game species benefit indirectly from management funded by consumptive use
of game species. In the USA, taxpayers broadly fund the State Wildlife Grants program that supports
non-game species management. Nonetheless, I value viewing opportunities for
game species as well, and that is a benefit that I have not paid for. 


## Collective choice arrangements

This principle requires that all individuals in the group participate in making decisions. 
This is pretty clearly false for wildlife management in the USA. All individuals in the
group do vote to elect politicians at the federal and state level, but that is a pretty 
indirect degree of participation. In some (most? check?) states, like my home state of 
Nebraska, fish and wildlife management decisions are made by a group of commissioners
who are appointed by the Governor, further reducing the participation of stakeholders. 
I suppose you can communicate with them if you're interested, but they are under no
obligation to listen. 


## Monitoring

Compliance with the rules agreed upon by the group needs to be monitored. This is
true for fish and wildlife management to a certain degree, but it is weak. Poaching
is illegal, and states have law enforcement dedicated to enforcing fish and game 
regulations. 

## Graduated sanctions

## Fast and fair conflict resolution

## Local autonomy

## Appropriate relations with other tiers of rule-making authority

This is also called "poly-centric governance".

At my darkest point, a single question dominated my thinking. Why continue to 
exist? Why continue consuming resources? Here I want to address how I answered 
those questions. I hope by sharing to help someone else, and perhaps, strengthen
my own connection to life.

# The basic problem

Existing consumes resources. Merely by breathing, standing still, my existence 
reduces the ability of other individuals and species to exist. And, if all I do
is breathe and stand still, I will not exist for long! I must eat. Construct 
shelter. My home stands on Tall grass prairie, perhaps one of the most endangered 
ecosystems on the planet. 
[Less than 2% of the Tallgrass ecosystem remains intact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie#Boundaries).
My home is a tiny fraction of the original $970000 km^2$, about $6 x 10^{-7} \%$! 
But our individually tiny bites add up. 

The problem is more acute for an atheist. Believers in a superhuman deity accept
their existence as a gift from that deity. Atheists lack this comfort!  

# My first solution

I have a right to exist. Without this bedrock assumption, suicide is the only
logical action. But who granted me that right? This is a fundamental precursor
of a living thing. Those earliest of living things that did not assert this right
did not persist. Those that did, continued to evolve. They did not question this
right, they merely asserted it by existing, consuming, and reproducing. So all
species, including humans, have this right. We (may be) the first species with 
the (dubious) ability to question this right. 

Yuval Harari, in *Sapiens*, asserts that atheists believe in a superhuman order,
that humanity is unique and most important among species. This belief is my right
to exist. I believe that any living thing, conscious enough to conceive of 
the question, would come to the same conclusion. 

Harari goes farther. He asserts that the "Worship of Humanity" includes the belief
that the Universe is given meaning by humanity. Personally, I'm willing to accept
that the Universe existed before us, and will continue to exist without us. It did
not arise to give us a place to be. 

# What is a right?



# Relation to Camus' solution

No idea yet

# How do Buddhists solve this problem? Confucians?



# The problem of taking

I have a right to exist, but so does every other species. How do I resolve the
dilemma that in order to exist, I must "take" individuals of other species. I use
"take" here, because existing involves more than eating. My home denies individual
lead plants  (*Amorph spp.*) space to exist and reproduce. The roads I use to 
get to my office. The supermarket where I forage. All these things "take", 
indirectly.

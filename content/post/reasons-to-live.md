At my darkest point, a single question dominated my thinking. Why continue to 
exist? Why continue consuming resources? Here I want to address how I answered 
those questions. I hope by sharing to help someone else, and perhaps, strengthen
my own connection to life.

# The basic problem

Existing consumes resources. Merely by breathing, standing still, my existence 
reduces the ability of other individuals and species to exist. And, if all I do
is breathe and stand still, I will not exist for long! I must eat. Construct 
shelter. My home stands on Tall grass prairie, perhaps one of the most endangered 
ecosystems on the planet. 
[Less than 2% of the Tallgrass ecosystem remains intact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie#Boundaries).
My home is a tiny fraction of the original $970000 km^2$, about $6 x 10^{-7} \%$! 
But our individually tiny bites add up. 

# My first solution

I have a right to exist. Without this bedrock assumption, suicide is the only
logical action. But who grants that right to me? This is a fundamental precursor
of a living thing. Those earliest of living things that did not assert this right
did not persist. Those that did, continued to evolve. They did not question this
right, they merely asserted it by existing, consuming, and reproducing. So all
species, including humans, have this right.

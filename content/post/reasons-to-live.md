At my darkest point, a single question dominated my thinking. Why continue to 
exist? Why continue consuming resources? I hope sharing 
how I answered those questions will help someone else, and perhaps, strengthen
my own connection to life[^life]. 

When I discussed these with a friend, she was surprised that the issue was 
not one of pure emotion. And certainly the darkest times are ones of low mood,
feelings of worthlessness and despair. Feelings, not logical arguments. Nonetheless
logical arguments were the weapons I chose to deploy against these feelings.
By searching for bedrock reasons why I should continue in the face of 
the worst storm of emotional anguish, I did. Continue, that is.

## The basic problem

Existing consumes resources. Merely by breathing, standing still, my existence 
reduces the ability of other individuals and species to exist. And, if all I do
is breathe and stand still, I will not exist for long! I must eat. Construct 
shelter. My home stands on Tall grass prairie, perhaps one of the most endangered 
ecosystems on the planet. 
[Less than 2% of the Tallgrass ecosystem remains intact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallgrass_prairie#Boundaries).
My home is a tiny fraction of the original $970000 km^2$, about $6 x 10^{-7} \%$! 
But our individually tiny bites add up. 

The problem is more acute for an atheist. Believers in a superhuman deity accept
their existence as a gift from that deity. Atheists lack this comfort!  

## My first solution

I have a right[^right] to exist. Without this bedrock assumption, suicide is the only
logical action. But who granted me that right? The right to exist is a fundamental precursor
of a living thing. Those earliest of living things that did not assert this right
did not persist. Those that did, continued to evolve. They did not question this
right, they merely asserted it by existing, consuming, and reproducing. So all
species, including humans, have this right. We (may be) the first species with 
the (dubious) ability to question this right. 

Yuval Harari, in *Sapiens*, asserts that atheists believe in a superhuman order,
that humanity is unique and most important among species[^more]. This belief is my right
to exist. I believe that any living thing, conscious enough to conceive of 
the question, would come to the same conclusion. 

## The problem of taking

I have a right to exist, but so do individuals of every other species. How do I resolve the
dilemma that in order to exist, I must "take" individuals of other species? I use
"take" here, because existing involves more than eating. My home denies individual
lead plants  (*Amorph spp.*) space to exist and reproduce. The roads I use to 
get to my office. The supermarket where I forage. All these things "take", 
indirectly. Eating a vegan diet doesn't get you off the hook here. How can I 
morally justify this taking of individuals who also have
a right to exist?

This tension between individuals' right to exist is ubiquitous. A
lion's (*Panthera leo*) individual right to exist conflicts with a Zebra's (*Equus 
burchelli*). A Zebra's right to exist conflicts with that of individual Madagascar 
crabgrass (*Digitaria milanjiana*)[^zebrafood]. One 
solution posits a right of a species to exist, that is more important than any
one individual. A lion's individual right to exist doesn't
conflict, usually, with the right of zebras as a species to exist. Individual zebras 
die, but the species persists. 

Enter *Homo sapiens*. At least since the last glacial maximim our species is the
apex predator on the planet. Human overkill is the dominant hypothesis for the 
[Quaternery extinction of the megafauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_extinction_event). 
[Nearly a quarter of Net Primary Production on the *planet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_production#Human_impact_and_appropriation) 
is directly or indirectly appropriated by us. As a moral agent, the egregious 
abolition of other species by my species is horrifying.  

I see a problem with this solution. Where does the right to exist for other 
species come from? A species is not a natural category, but one created for our
convience. Is the right of another species to exist just a convienent fig leaf?

## Conclusion

For now, I'm satisfied with my answers to these questions. I may never have a 
perfect answer, but satisfication is good enough. When my brain is throwing up
the worst thoughts, when my own mood regulation is so damaged I can't help but
feel worthless, I fall back on arguments like these. It helps remind me that the
worthlessness, the constant thoughts of self-annihilation, are not me, but symptoms.

[^life]: I couldn't sleep because I was having trouble reconstructing these arguments in my head. Writing them down makes them better.

[^right]: I use this word in the sense of [an ethical principle of entitlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights).

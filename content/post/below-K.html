<p>I often hear the phrase, “This population is below <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> so …”. But what does the
trajectory of such a population look like? I think it should be increasing. But apparently
not everyone agrees. The usual context of this statement is interpreting what
kind of birth and death rates to expect. If a population is “below <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>”, then birth
rates should exceed death rates. If they are not, then <em>something</em> (disease,
predation, hunting) is causing birth rates to fall or death rates to rise.</p>
<p>I’ve always thought of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> as an abstract point, the position on the population
size spectrum<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> where birth and death rates are equal. In my thinking,
if a disease arrives that reduces recruitment <a href="https://www.omaha.com/outdoors/pneumonia-wreaking-havoc-among-bighorn-sheep-in-nebraska-s-pine/article_ce95d13b-1d0c-5b47-ba02-316daa969d56.html">(e.g. by killing newborns)</a>, then
<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (and maybe <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span>) is reduced because the birth rate curve shifts downwards.
But apparently not everyone thinks of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in this arbitrary mathematical way.</p>
<p>I know there are many flavors of the term “carrying capacity”. For example, “social
carrying capacity” as used by wildlife managers describes how many individuals of
a species humans are prepared to accept.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I think of my use of carrying
capacity as “ecological carrying capacity”, the size of a population that growth
tends towards in the absence of stochastic effects. But maybe this needs to be
unpacked a bit more.</p>
<p>Thinking of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> as a single thing creates a problem: my mathematical point
does not stay constant. It bounces around in response to environmental stochasticity.
In years with good rainfall <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is higher for deer than in drought years.
It trends over time in response to slow variables like landuse change. But the
common usage suggests that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> does <em>not</em> change. I think we need two concepts:
<span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_{max}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> is the mathematical point I just described, and includes all the vagries of
the environment, disease, predators etc. It is specific to a point in time and
indeed, space. In contrast, <span class="math inline">\(K_{max}\)</span> is constant, a feature of the species’ life
history. In a given habitat<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, at what population size do birth rates equal
death rates equal given only intra-specific competition.</p>
<p>I picked the <span class="math inline">\(K_{max}\)</span> notation to correspond to <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span>, the intrinsic rate of
growth, or the difference in birth and death rates when intra-specific competition
is absent. This has a pleasing conceptual symmetry, but actually creates a problem.
I use <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> in the sense of <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span>, that is, the maximum rate of growth including
all the vagaries of the ecosystem. I use <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span> as the observed per capita rate of growth at
a particular point in time. So, if <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> is now the life history constant, <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span> is the
particular maximum growth rate at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then what is <span class="math inline">\(ln\left(\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}\right)\)</span>?</p>
<p>My constants <span class="math inline">\(K_{max}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_{max}\)</span> have an interesting property. They are unobservable.
Given two population estimates you can “observe” <span class="math inline">\(ln\left(\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}\right)\)</span>.
By analogy with the distinction between population and sample statistics, I could use
<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{max}\)</span> for the life history constant, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t\)</span> for the value at a specific
time, and then <span class="math inline">\(r_t = ln\left(\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}\right)\)</span> just makes sense! Maybe.
Conceptually <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span> is not the same beast as <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t\)</span> because the latter is independent
of <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>Getting this notation right is not a triviality. It affects how students learn.
I’ve noticed many of my students struggle with this exact conceptual distinction
between <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_t\)</span>. One is an unobservable property of the system, and the
other is an estimated quantity. Maybe I should put a hat on <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}\)</span>.
Another interesting connection:
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}_t = f\left(\hat{N}_t | \rho_t, K_t\right)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here, really. I suspect the vague notation and terminology is so
deeply engrained in generations of ecologists that clarifying it at this point
is well nigh impossible. What do you think? Comments welcome below!</p>

Here, I think of habitat as a type of vegetation in a particular location, averaged at a resolution of at least the home range of the species in question.

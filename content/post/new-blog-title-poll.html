<p>I’d like to change the title of this blog, so <a href="https://twitter.com/atiretoo/status/1087407091252449283">I solicited suggestions on Twitter</a> and Facebook.
There were some great ones! Then I <a href="https://twitter.com/atiretoo/status/1087694051221024768">held a poll</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># WARNING: public use of this package can lead to social media abuse. 
library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 

poll &lt;- tribble(
  ~Title, ~votes,
  &quot;Irregularly Tyre-annical&quot;, 2,
  &quot;Tyre Repair&quot;, 7,
  &quot;Small things done great&quot;, 0,
  &quot;Where the rubber meets the road&quot;, 6
)

ggplot(data = poll, aes(x=reorder(Title, votes), y = votes)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(y = &quot;Title&quot;, x = &quot;Votes&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Boo. My personal contribution scored 0. Although the winner is “Tyre Repair”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the
sample size is small, and I couldn’t help wondering if there was a statistically
significant difference between that and “Where the rubber meets the road”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
This is a blog partly about statistics after all.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;EMT&quot;)
mt &lt;- multinomial.test(poll$votes, prob = rep(1/4, 4))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Exact Multinomial Test, distance measure: p
## 
##     Events    pObs    p.value
##        816   2e-04     0.0171</code></pre>
<p>But that’s not a terribly interesting hypothesis – it says that my voters care
what title I use. What I really want to know
is if there is any that beats all the others. I discovered <a href="http://www.biostathandbook.com/chigof.html">a post-hoc test for
for the Exact GOF</a>, essentially
testing each category against the sum of the others, and using Bonferroni corrections.
So I’ll have 4 comparisons, and thus my p value should be less than 0.05/4 = 0.0125.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pvals &lt;- tribble(
  ~Comparison, ~p,
  &quot;Irregularly Tyre-annical vs. others&quot;,  multinomial.test(c(2,13), prob = c(0.25, 0.75))$p.value,
  &quot;Tyre Repair vs. others&quot;,  multinomial.test(c(7,8), prob = c(0.25, 0.75))$p.value,
  &quot;Small things done great vs. others&quot;,  multinomial.test(c(0,15), prob = c(0.25, 0.75))$p.value,
  &quot;Where the rubber meets the road vs. others&quot;,  multinomial.test(c(6,9), prob = c(0.25, 0.75))$p.value
)</code></pre>
<p>I had to hide the results of that code chunk because package EMT isn’t very nice
about output.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::kable(pvals)</code></pre>

<p>So, basically none of the individual titles can be ruled out! Hmmm. Maybe I have
the wrong hypotheses here.</p>
<p>Well, there
was also a great write-in candidate “Entyrely Optional”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and protests to re-open
the polls erupted. So I think I will try again with the top two from the first
round plus the new candidate.</p>

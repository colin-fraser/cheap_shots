I often hear the phrase, "This population is below $K$ so ...". But what does the
trajectory of such a population look like? I think it should be increasing. But apparently 
not everyone agrees. The usual context of this statement is interpreting what 
kind of birth and death rates to expect. If a population is "below $K$", then birth
rates should exceed death rates. If they are not, then *something* (disease, 
predation, hunting) is causing birth rates to fall or death rates to rise. 

I've always thought of $K$ as an abstract point, the position on the population
size spectrum[^spectrum] where birth and death rates are equal. In my thinking,
if a disease arrives that reduces recruitment [(e.g. by killing newborns)](https://www.omaha.com/outdoors/pneumonia-wreaking-havoc-among-bighorn-sheep-in-nebraska-s-pine/article_ce95d13b-1d0c-5b47-ba02-316daa969d56.html), then
$K$ (and maybe $r_{max}$) is reduced because the birth rate curve shifts downwards.
But apparently not everyone thinks of $K$ in this arbitrary mathematical way.

I often hear the phrase, "This population is below $K$ so ...". But what does the
trajectory of such a population look like? I think it should be increasing. But apparently 
not everyone agrees. The usual context of this statement is interpreting what 
kind of birth and death rates to expect. If a population is "below $K$", then birth
rates should exceed death rates. If they are not, then *something* (disease, 
predation, hunting) is causing birth rates to fall or death rates to rise. 

I've always thought of $K$ as an abstract point, the position on the population
size spectrum[^spectrum] where birth and death rates are equal. In my thinking,
if a disease arrives that reduces recruitment [(e.g. by killing newborns)](https://www.omaha.com/outdoors/pneumonia-wreaking-havoc-among-bighorn-sheep-in-nebraska-s-pine/article_ce95d13b-1d0c-5b47-ba02-316daa969d56.html), then
$K$ (and maybe $r_{max}$) is reduced because the birth rate curve shifts downwards.
But apparently not everyone thinks of $K$ in this arbitrary mathematical way.

I know there are many flavors of the term "carrying capacity". For example, "social 
carrying capacity" as used by wildlife managers describes how many individuals of 
a species humans are prepared to accept.[^social] I think of my use of carrying 
capacity as "ecological carrying capacity", the size of a population that growth
tends towards in the absence of stochastic effects. But maybe this needs to be 
unpacked a bit more. 

Thinking of $K$ as a single thing creates a problem: my mathematical point
does not stay constant. It bounces around in response to environmental stochasticity.
In years with good rainfall $K$ is higher for deer than in drought years. 
It trends over time in response to slow variables like landuse change. But the 
common usage suggests that $K$ does *not* change. I think we need two concepts: 
$K_t$ and $K_{max}$. 

$K_t$ is the mathematical point I just described, and includes all the vagries of
the environment, disease, predators etc. It is specific to a point in time and 
indeed, space. In contrast, $K_{max}$ is constant, a feature of the species' life
history. In a given habitat[^habitat], at what population size do birth rates equal
death rates equal given only intra-specific competition.


[^spectrum]: I just made this up. I love being an academic and getting to coin new jargon.

[^social]: The concept is not without criticism - [this is a fascinating read.](https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/01/08/the-politspeak-of-social-carrying-capacity/)

[^habitat]: introducing another vague term here! Here, I think of habitat as a type of vegetation in a particular location, averaged at a resolution of at least the home range of the species in question. This works just fine for big horn sheep, but what about predators?

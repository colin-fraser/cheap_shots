One of the exercises I make Ecological Statistics students do is 
[work backwards from a given value of the dependent variable in a regression
to the corresponding values of the independent variable](/classes/NRES803/Week_2/homework_2/). I usually just get them
to eyeball it from a table of predictions. But today a student brought the
"terms" type of prediction to my attention.[^1] What is this magic?

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
df <- tibble(x1 = 1:10,
             x2 = rep(1:5, each = 2),
             y1 = -5 + 1 * x1 + rnorm(10),
             y2 = 0 + 1 * x1 - 1 * x2 + rnorm(10),
             y3 = 0 + 0 * x1 + 1 * x1^2)

```

One of the exercises I make Ecological Statistics students do is 
[work backwards from a given value of the dependent variable in a regression
to the corresponding values of the independent variable](/classes/NRES803/Week_2/homework_2/). I usually just get them
to eyeball it from a table of predictions. But today a student suggested the
"terms" type of prediction might be the answer. Unfortunately I've never
tried to figure out what type = "terms" actually does[^1]. What is this magic?

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
df <- tibble(x1 = 1:10,
             x2 = rep(1:5, each = 2),
             y1 = -5 + 1 * x1 + rnorm(10),
             y2 = 0 + 1 * x1 - 1 * x2 + rnorm(10),
             y3 = 25 -10 * x1 + 1 * x1^2) 
mod1 <- lm(y1~x1, data = df)
mod2 <- lm(y1~x1 + x2, data = df)
mod3 <- lm(y1~x1 + x1^2, data = df)
```

OK, so we've got three models, one with a single predictor, one with two predictors, and one with a polynomial model. When there is a single 
predictor, there is only a single value of the independent variable that
gives that value of the dependent variable. In mathematical terms the linear
function is "invertible" -- you can run it both ways and get a unique 
answer. 

```{r}
predict(mod1, type = "terms")
```

OK, if that was useful for "inverse prediction" it would be related to the values of x1, but it isn't. It's the fitted value (y) plus a constant.

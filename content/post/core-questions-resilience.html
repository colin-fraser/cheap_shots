<p>Resilience theory (Gunderson et al 2009) postulates that ecosystems have multiple stable states, and that the amount of effort, energy, or disturbance required to shift an ecosystem into a different state is a measure of how likely that system is to persist – the resilience. Managing for resilience is difficult if it cannot be measured, which requires a clear operational definition. Defining resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to persist in the face of perturbations, requires first defining what an ecosystem is – otherwise it is impossible to say when the ecosystem has changed. There are two types of possible changes: from one ecosystem to a completely different ecosystem, and from one state of an ecosystem to another state of the same ecosystem. Superficially these two changes appear similar, but they are not. The second type of change presupposes that ecosystems are “universals” – a class of entities that exist independently of instantiations of the class. Operationalizing resilience theory thus requires answers to two questions. First, are ecosystems universals? Second, when is a current observation of an ecosystem different from a previous observation at the same location; either a different ecosystem or a different state of the same ecosystem?</p>
<p>Holling’s (1973) original work on ecological resilience primarily focused on domains of attraction within differential equation models of a small number of interacting species; a shift to a new domain of attraction corresponds to a new ecosystem “state”. Under this definition, an ecosystem can be in two different states with the same list of species. Later in the same work, he suggested that the loss of a species was equivalent to a shift to a new ecosystem state. In later work (Holling 1993?), he relaxed this species centric definition to one that used the persistence of ecosystem functions. Regardless of whether the metrics are functions or species, Holling’s work is consistent with the view that ecosystems are universals that can have multiple instances. Each instance can be in a different state, measured by the presence of functions or particular species. For the moment, assume that ecosystems are universals, and that we need to answer the question of recognizing two different states of the same ecosystem in order to measure resilience.</p>
<p>The second question makes a careful presumption – the two observations are in the same location in space. I make a second presumption that the distribution of driving physical variables between the two observations is the same as before the first observation. Note that this is not the same as assuming the conditions are exactly the same; that is impossible. However, it does presume that variables such as precipitation and temperature are coming from the same distributions. Thus, any changes observed are not due to shifts in the climate system. This is somewhat tricky territory – is a multi-year drought the same climate distribution as the preceding decade? For the moment, I will exclude such shifts in driving physical variables. The distributions of driving variables, whatever they are, are assumed to be stationary. To be even more concrete, I will specify that my observations pertain to some specific extent in space and time. This is important, because it is clear that both the grain (size of the smallest observation) and extent of an observation will affect what is considered to be the same and what is taken to be different. For example, observing a hectare plot of tall grass prairie early in the spring and late in the summer will yield very different lists of species: migratory birds, insects, and many annual plants will not be present in the first observation.</p>
<p>Consider that hectare of tall grass prairie, but at a slightly larger temporal grain – an entire year – so that such within year fluctuations in species abundances are averaged over. What about that system has to change before I call it a different state of the same ecosystem? If I delete a species, is it the same state? What about adding a species?
What if the species being added or deleted is a large herbivore, like the bison?
What if I invert the species abundance curve – the rarest species is now the most abundant and vice versa?
What if the plot is burned in between the two observations?</p>
<p>Context of the plot matters as well – the metacommunity is the source of recolonization. A plot that is open to bison is different from one that has a fence around it. There is an interaction between the trajectory following a disturbance, the landscape context, and the extent to which a species relies on dispersal from “outside” the plot.</p>
<p>The extent of reliance of a species on dispersal from outside the plot could be measured by a simple ratio – what percentage of a species’ genotypes was sourced from within the plot, vs. from outside the plot. This takes care of the aphid example – most of the aphid biomass within a one hectare plot of grassland developed inside that plot, but if the plot is isolated example of the tallgrass state, then aphids are likely to disappear following disturbance because they would have to recolonize the plot from outside. In contrast, a forb that grows vegetatively, has animal pollinated flowers, and a small seed dispersal kernel, most of the genotypes present will have been sourced from within the plot. The extent of that species in the plot following disturbance will depend on the species ability to withstand the disturbance, either by resistance or avoidance (seed bank).</p>
<p>What if the plot is plowed and then left?
How is that different from a plot on the slopes of Mount St. Helens before and after the 1987 eruption?
Imagine replacing all the plants with a super-engineered corn-wheat-soybean hybrid that has the same primary production, biogeochemical cycling properties, and resource availability for higher trophic levels as the original tall grass prairie. Is it still the same ecosystem? If you define an ecosystem based on the physical properties then you did not change the ecosystem, so in principle you could engineer ecosystems that look very different from our current ones. In that case you have two different states of the ecosystem, a natural one and an engineered one. If you allow for engineering ecosystem a name change would be appropriate, say mesic grasslands.</p>
<p>Ian Noble’s work on semi-Markov representations of ecosystems and communities is relevant here.</p>
<p>Review definitions of “ecosystem” from Gleasonian and Clementsian perspectives – how can they be distinguished?</p>
<p>Review Ecosystems articles for uses of the term ecosystem.</p>
<p>Review the Resilience Alliance work for their definition of a shift in state – how does that definition relate to this idea?</p>
<p>The notion of an ecosystem service can lead to the dangerous thought that ecosystems exist for a purpose. Under a XXX view of ecosystems, this is possible, because ecosystems as universals are created by our perceptions of the world. In contrast, if ecosystems are mere aggregations of species that happen to co-occur in a single location with common biotic and abiotic environments, then there can be no purpose other than that expressed by the organisms themselves. Ecosystem services are by-products of each genotype’s effort to exploit the resource opportunities afforded by local conditions to maximize fitness. This view actually makes the need for frequent, small disturbances to maintain ecosystem services under a range of conditions very apparent. Disturbances create different biotic and abiotic conditions in a locality, which will be exploited if appropriate genotypes are present. If ecosystem services are by products of genotypes struggle for existence, then eliminating disturbances eliminates the conditions that those genotypes need to exist. Thus, when a large disturbance eventually does happen, none of the genotypes adapted for those conditions remain, and ecosystem services are then unavailable as a result. A sufficiently large disturbance may then also eliminate the biotic conditions necessary to restore the previous suite of genotypes, resulting in an enduring loss of ecosystem services.</p>

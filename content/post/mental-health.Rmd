Mental health is a huge issue in academia right now (see this, this, or this, or that). 
Many say the most important thing to normalize this, to get over thinking of it as stigma, is to own up to it.
And so to do my bit, I suffer clinical depression. 

Before I go any farther, *right now*, I am doing very well, thank you.

Some close to me were alarmed that I would tell people about experiencing depression. 
Last fall I told my boss. 
Now I'm telling everyone! 
Surely there will be negative consequences?

Which is entirely the point. There could be, and there shouldn't be. It's no different from saying I'm a Type 2 diabetic.[^1] 
It is a chronic condition that affects my behavior and life expectancy. Also, for the same reason, I should speak up. 
If I can't weather the blow back (if any) as a atheist cisgender heterosexual white male fully promoted professor, then there really *is* a problem. The privilege is leaking out of my ears.
Still, its taken me a long time to get to the point where I could write this. 

[^1]: I am!

When I read about others' experience of mental health issues, I'm blown away by the terrible situations that develop. 
My own situation is so priveleged, I often think "how can I complain?" 
I should just suck it up. 
But I can't. It is an illness. 
Yes, there is a lot of personal work that I can, and am, doing to improve my mental state. 
But there's no switch I can flip, no magic bullet. 
I take medication, and that helps. A lot. But it isn't enough.
The medication helps me put a floor on how far I fall when things go bad. 

I'm not going to try and describe what it's like to be in the grip of depression. 
I could never do as well as [Andrew Solomon's TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share?utm_campaign=tedspread--a&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare). 
Trigger warning: I burst into tears the first time I watched this -- the description was so spot on.  

In 2012, three years after getting tenure, I was at the peak of my career. 
I had brought in some big(-ish) grants, my students were successful, papers were churning out and I had stimulating collaborations. 
Then I just fell apart. More or less. 
I vividly recall sitting in the parking lot of my building one day, calling a collaborator and saying I couldn't make a meeting. 
I couldn't do anything except sit there and cry. 
Luckily UNL has a good employee assistance program, and I had visited with a counselor a few years before to talk about stress management. 
The counselor diagnosed me as clinically depressed in a few minutes. 

TIL: it is not normal to think about suicide on a daily basis. Who knew! I sure didn't. 
Now I know that those thoughts are just symptoms. 
I treat them as such, just like measuring a high glucose reading is a symptom that my diet isn't controlling my diabetes. 
$Suicidal thoughts / day > 0$ is a sign something is off.
In hindsight, it's a good thing I've never owned a gun.
I'm also incredibly lucky to have a loving family. 
Thinking about what my suicide would do to them kept me alive. 

In hindsight, it seems pretty clear that I was experiencing depression for many years prior to that total collapse. 
Maybe I'd have spotted it sooner if mental illness was more widely discussed and acknowledged.
I might have thought to ask my physician about a normal frequency of suicidal thoughts (zero!).

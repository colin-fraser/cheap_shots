Mental health is a huge issue in academia right now (see this, this, or this, or that). 
Many say the most important thing to normalize this, to get over thinking of it as stigma, is to own up to it.
And so to do my bit, I suffer clinical depression. 

Before I go any farther, *right now*, I am doing very well, thank you.

Some close to me were alarmed that I would tell people about experiencing depression. 
Last fall I told my boss. 
Now I'm telling everyone! 
Surely there will be negative consequences?

Which is entirely the point. There could be, and there shouldn't be. It's no different from saying I'm a Type 2 diabetic. 
It is a chronic condition that affects my behavior and life expectancy. Also, for the same reason, I should speak up. 
If I can't weather the blow back (if any) as a atheist cisgender heterosexual white male fully promoted professor, then there really *is* a problem. The privilege is leaking out of my ears.
Still, its taken me more than a year to get to the point where I could write this.

I now regularly test models using cross validation. I use a "calibration curve" to see whether the predictions from independent data fit the observed data. What I don't have is a good citation for why this should be so. It's a bit like asking for a citation for breathing. *Of course*, the expected values are $\beta_0 = 0$ and $\beta_1 = 1$! 

But, I need to find a citation. In my brief search so far I found David Cox [(1958)](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/cox/cox49.pdf) wrote about this hypothesis for a binary regression model. That wasn't in the context of cross validation however.

<p>A few years ago I built a white-tailed deer population model to evaluate different
harvest strategies. 2 sexes, density dependence, age structure, it was fun. The
main problem I came across was figuring out how changes in population
size and structure would interact with management to change harvest mortality.
In consumer-resource modeling terminology, I didn’t know what the functional
response of hunters was. So here’s my first shot at it.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, I will just think about 2 types of deer, does (<span class="math inline">\(N_d\)</span>)
and bucks (<span class="math inline">\(N_b\)</span>). Furthermore, hunters always prefer bucks. In practice this
means if they encounter a buck they harvest it. The real trick is figuring out
what they do when they encounter a doe. Simplifying again, each permit only
allows 1 deer, so if they take a doe then that precludes taking a buck.
Each hunter has some limited time in which to harvest any animal (limited season).
Simplifying, assume that’s the same for all hunters. Finally, hunters encounter
deer at rates proportional to their abundance <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(N)\)</span>. This rate depends
on deer behavior, hunter behavior, and the habitat involved.</p>
<p>If hunters have discrete intervals in which to encounter a deer, then this is kind
of like a negative binomial distribution – how many non-bucks are encountered
before encountering a buck. The problem is we have two kinds of events, not one.
For a single interval</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(buck | N) = 1-e^{\lambda N_b} \\
p(doe | N) = (1-e^{\lambda N_d})(1-p(buck)) \\
p(nothing) = (1 - p(buck))(1-p(doe))
\]</span></p>
<p>Here I assume that if a doe and a buck are encountered, the hunter always takes
the buck and ignores the doe. Also, if more than one buck or doe is encountered
that’s the same as encountering one.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a dynamic programming problem – there are T intervals, and on each
interval the decision is to take a doe or not, given you’ve encountered one.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(t) = p(buck) + p(doe) max(v_d, V(t+1)) + p(nothing) V(t+1)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq v_d \leq 1\)</span> is the relative value of a doe compared to a buck.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
lambda &lt;-  0.01
N &lt;-  c(doe = 100, buck = 20)
vd &lt;-  0.5
p_enc &lt;- function(N, lambda){
  c(pbuck = 1 - exp(-lambda*N[2]),
    pdoe = (1 - exp(-lambda*N[1]))*(exp(-lambda*N[2])),
    pnone = (exp(-lambda*N[1]))*(exp(-lambda*N[2])))
    }
V &lt;- vector(&quot;numeric&quot;, length = 20)
V1 &lt;- vector(&quot;numeric&quot;, length = 20)
V2 &lt;- vector(&quot;numeric&quot;, length = 20)
D &lt;- vector(&quot;character&quot;, length = 20)

for(t in 19:1){
  V1[t] &lt;- vd
  V2[t] &lt;- V[t+1]

    D[t] &lt;- &quot;accept&quot;
    V[t] &lt;- V1[t]
  } else {
    D[t] &lt;- &quot;reject&quot;
    V[t] &lt;- V2[t]
  }
  V[t] &lt;- p[1] + p[2] * V[t] + p[3] * V[t+1]

       mapping = aes(x = t)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(y = Value, linetype = Choice)) + 
  labs(x = &quot;Time&quot;, y = &quot;Value&quot;, 
       caption = &quot;Expected value of rejecting or accepting a doe. N_doe = 100, N_buck = 20, lambda = 0.01, v_doe = 0.5&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>So with these parameters you should reject a doe until there are only a few
opportunities left, and then you should start accepting them. That makes sense
to me. Now I need to convert that into a model for the probability of harvesting
a buck, doe, or nothing.</p>
<div id="as-a-function-of-t_switch" class="section level1">
<h1>As a function of <span class="math inline">\(t_{switch}\)</span></h1>
<p>The DP tells me there will be a switch point. Before the switch, only accept bucks,
after the switch, accept any deer. So I can write the value function like this</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(t_{switch}) = (1 - (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}) + \\
(1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}(1-p(none)^{T-t_{switch}})(p(doe)v_d + p(buck))
\]</span></p>
<p>The first term is the probability of getting a buck before the switch point. The
second term is the probability of <em>not</em> getting a buck before the switch, times
the probability of getting <em>something</em>, times the expected value of something.</p>
</div>
<div id="probability-of-harvesting-a-buck-or-doe" class="section level1">
<h1>Probability of harvesting a buck or doe</h1>
<p>So this approach is getting to what I need, which is the probability a hunter
takes a buck or a doe, or is unsuccessful. Before the switch is easy; after the
switch is harder.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
P_{buck} = &amp; (1 - (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}) + \\
  &amp; (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}(p(buck) + p(none)p(buck) + ... + p(none)^{T-t_{switch}-1}p(buck)) \\
 = &amp; (1 - (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}) + \\
  &amp; (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}p(buck)\frac{1-p(none)^{T-t_{switch}-1}}{1-p(none)}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>because the second part of the second term is a geometric series.
Similarly for a doe, except we don’t need the first term</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
P_{doe} = &amp; (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}(p(doe) + p(none)p(doe) + ... + p(none)^{T-t_{switch}-1}p(doe)) \\
 = &amp; (1-p(buck))^{t_{switch}}p(doe)\frac{1-p(none)^{T-t_{switch}-1}}{1-p(none)}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
</div>

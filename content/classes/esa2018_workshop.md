My goal is to take everyone through the process of importing a dataset, visualizing it, running a simple analysis (e.g. linear regression/ANOVA), examining the results and getting a publication quality report out at the end.

## Setup

Before the workshop, you need to [install some software on your computer][computer-setup]. 

You should also install packages `lme4`, `lsmeans`, `lmerTest`. I will also use package `pander` to 
make nice tables, but this is optional.

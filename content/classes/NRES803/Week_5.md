## Generalized Linear Models

In this week we’ll look at breaking the assumptions that the error distribution is normal and the relationship between E(Y) and BX is linear.
### Learning Objectives

* Recognize binomial and Poisson distributed responses
* Evaluate the goodness of fit of a GLM by examining residual plots and the residual deviance.

### Monday

### Tuesday

Post pre-proposal in discussion board by Tuesday 11:59 pm. You have until Tuesday 11:59 pm of Week 6 to post comments on other proposals and respond to comments on your own.

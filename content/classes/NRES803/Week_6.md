## Generalized Additive Models

In this week we’ll look at breaking the assumption that the covariates are linearly related to the inverse link of E(Y).

### Learning Objectives

* Detect violations of the linear assumption in residual plots
* Use a penalized smooth spline term to fit an arbitrary non-linear function
* Decide what type of model to use based on the properties of the data


### Monday

1. Here's a handout that I call [putting it all together](tyre-Putting_it_all_together-2012-9-26.pdf). I'm not sure when the best time is give you this handout, but now seems to be a good time. In the first part, which deals with deciding what sort of models to fit, when you get to step 6 just answer NO and you'll be good. Otherwise you will probably understand what the answer yes means in a few weeks. The 2nd part is my guidelines for model selection. These are my opinion and a fair facsimile of my usual practice; they should not be taken as absolute rules supported by independent statistical theory. 

2. Optional online help session 10-11, read, watch videos, homework, discuss the handout if needed.

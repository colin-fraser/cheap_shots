## Description {#description}

We will cover a broad sample of statistical topics relevant to
ecologists; the intent is to provide an introduction enabling student to
intelligently follow a seminar or scientific paper utilizing these
methods. Depending on the needs and interests of the students we will
enable students to conduct analyses on their own for a subset of topics.
Across all topics we will emphasize modern methods of model
selection/multi-model inference and relevant study design questions.
Topics will include generalized linear and additive models, mixed
models, and survival analysis. We will use the software package R. Each
student will present a data analysis problem of their choice, implement
an ecological analysis, and prepare a written paper summarizing the
analysis and results.

## Learning Objectives 

*By the end of the course the students will be able to:*

1.  Identify and summarize statistical results as presented in peer
    reviewed articles
2.  Compare and contrast the outputs of a model selection processes
    based on Frequentist or Information Theoretic methods
3.  Use R to conduct model based analyses of ecological data
4.  Combine statistical results and ecological knowledge to support a
    conclusion

## Instructor's Role 

This course is offered fully online, in an asynchronous fashion. I will
have online "office hours" using Adobe Connect Monday at 10 - 12 pm,
Wednesday at 10-12 am and Friday between 2 and 5 pm. At other times I
will read items posted in the discussion groups within 24 hours of
posting during the week, and within 48 hours over the weekend. I will
respond if needed to clarify a question or comment, answer a question,
or clarify a response by another course participant. If you send in a
question via email, I will repost it in a discussion thread
and answer it there. You will get your answer much more quickly by
posting in the discussion thread directly.

I am also available by telephone at the number above during the week,
generally between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm. If I am not at my desk, I
typically respond to voice mail messages within 4 hours.

## Hardware and Software Requirements {#hardsoft}

Any modern pc or mac should be able to run all of the software we will
use in this course. An internet connection is needed to access course
materials on Blackboard, and submit assignments. Participating in the
online help sessions requires an internet connection, a microphone, and
speakers. The integrated microphone and speakers on a laptop are
typically not sufficient, but a cheap pair of earbuds will reduce or
eliminate issues with feedback. A USB headset that combines headphones
and a microphone is optimal. A webcam, either integrated or standalone,
also helps interaction online because I can see when you're not getting
it even if you're not telling me in words!

All of the statistical software we will use is available as open source.
Links to software [can be found
here](computer-setup/).

## Assessment / Grading {#assessment}

### Lab assignments 10%

In many weeks you will complete a lab assignment that will walk you
through various steps in using R and analyzing data. These formative
assignments contribute to your grade, but generally you will earn full
points simply for completing all the steps.

### Homework assignments 30%

There are 8 homework problems; generally these will require you to
conduct an analysis of a provided dataset and interpret the results in
written form. Due dates are Tuesday of the week indicated in the course
schedule.

### Paper discussions 20%

In each module there will be one or more opportunities to discuss papers
either about that analysis or that use that analysis. These will occur
online, as required by the course schedule. They will be graded on the
basis of 2 components - preparedness and participation. Preparedness
will be assessed by having each student post to a discussion thread a
direct quote from each paper. 

### Project 40%

The project will involve a more thorough analysis and writeup of a
particular dataset. In the first weeks of the course students will
present a dataset of their choice; students without a dataset to analyze
should visit with the instructor as soon as possible. These initial
pre-proposals will be short (&lt; 2 pages), and should include the
following information:

1.  What is the ecological hypothesis or model of interest?
2.  What variables were measured?
3.  What do you THINK the best analysis is?

These pre-proposals should be posted to a Blackboard discussion thread.
Your grade for the pre-proposal will include a component for
participation in online discussions of projects; the pre-proposal and
discussion together are 25% of the project grade. Midway through the
course I expect a written proposal for the analysis â€“ this will be two
to three pages and essentially form a draft introduction and
methods/materials section for the final paper. This written proposal is
worth another 25% of your grade. **On DECEMBER 5, 2017** you will post a
narrated powerpoint or flash video to Blackboard giving a formal
conference style presentation of your project â€“ the maximum length is 10
minutes. This is worth 25% of your project grade. The final paper will
be **due DECEMBER 12, 2017 at 5pm Central Time**. The form of the paper
should be a brief research article formatted as a manuscript suitable
for submission to the journal of your choice (e.g. Journal of Wildlife
Management, Biometrics). Note the final paper is in lieu of an exam, and
is worth 25% of the project grade.

Note that I am not grading attendance at the synchronous sessions. You
are welcome to skip those or jump ahead as you wish.

**Grading Scale**

The total points assessed will be translated into letter grades as
follows: &lt;60 F, 60-69 D, 70-79 C, 80-89 B, 90-100 A. I do not use
minus grades, and give plus grades to scores in the top 20% of each
band.

## Course Policies

### Late Assignments

Unless you have a good reason ("my computer's down" doesn't qualify), I
cannot give full credit for late assignments - it is not fair to
everyone else. Work received up to one week late after the due date will
lose a grade (10%). Work received more than one week late up until the
last day of class will lose two grades (20%). All assignments will be
turned in via Canvas so they will be timestamped. Always keep a
digital or hard copy of assignments you turn in. All paper discussion
assignments must be turned in on time; no late summaries will be
accepted.

### Academic Integrity Statement

Students are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic
dishonesty outlined in Article III B.1 of University's [Student Code of
Conduct](http://stuafs.unl.edu/dos/code). A first offense will result in
a 10% penalty on the assignment. A second offense will result in a grade
of zero for the assignment. A third offense will result in a grade of F
for the course. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor for
clarification of these guidelines if they have questions or concerns.
The SNR policy on Academic Dishonesty and procedures for appeals are
available
[here](http://snr.unl.edu/employeeinfo/information/employeehandbook-single.asp?infocode=S162).

### Netiquette

Core rules of Netiquette:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Students with Disabilities {#disabilities}

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for
a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic
accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to
provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with
documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully
participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To
receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield
Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

### In case of emergency 

#### Fire Alarm (or other evacuation)

In the event of a fire alarm: Gather belongings (Purse, keys, cellphone,
N-Card, etc.) and use the nearest exit to leave the building. Do not use
the elevators. After exiting notify emergency personnel of the location
of persons unable to exit the building. Do not return to building unless
told to do so by emergency personnel.

#### Tornado Warning

When sirens sound, move to the lowest interior area of building or
designated shelter. Stay away from windows and stay near an inside wall
when possible.

#### Active Shooter

Evacuate: if there is a safe escape path, leave belongings behind, keep
hands visible and follow police officer instructions.

Hide out: If evacuation is impossible secure yourself in your space by
turning out lights, closing blinds and barricading doors if possible.

Take action: As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent
danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter.

UNL Alert: Notifications about serious incidents on campus are sent via
text message, email, unl.edu website, and social media. For more
information go to: <http://unlalert.unl.edu>.

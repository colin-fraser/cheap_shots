***NRES 803 students will need their own computers set up with R and RStudio by the start of 
classes***

### R

Download and install the [R base system](http://cran.rstudio.com/). I recommend you use the [R studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to work with the base system. Download and install the RStudio Desktop system.

### Getting help

The built-in help works well when you know what you're looking for. For other issues, [here is a great list of resources](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/info). In this course you can also post questions in the discussion board in Canvas. Please read [this description of how to ask a great question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).

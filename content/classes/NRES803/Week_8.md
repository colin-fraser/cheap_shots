## Putting it all together

Reinforcing and reviewing all the bits we've done up to now.

### Learning Objectives



### Monday

1. Here's a handout that I call [putting it all together](tyre-Putting_it_all_together-2012-9-26.pdf). I'm not sure when the best time is give you this handout, but now seems to be a good time. In the first part, which deals with deciding what sort of models to fit, when you get to step 6 just answer NO and you'll be good. Otherwise you will probably understand what the answer yes means in a few weeks. The 2nd part is my guidelines for model selection. These are my opinion and a fair facsimile of my usual practice; they should not be taken as absolute rules supported by independent statistical theory. 

2. Optional online help session 10-11, read, watch videos, homework.

### Tuesday

1. [Week 6 Homework](../week_6/homework_6/) due Tuesday at 11:59pm. 

### Wednesday

1. Before Wednesdayâ€™s class

    * Read AED Chapter 20, 21 (application chapters)
    * Review AED figures 3.1 and 3.2.
    * Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/DTgVfNnItnc) where I attempt to explain Generalized Cross Validation

### Friday

1. [Friday's lab assignment](lab_8/) has lots of looking at residual plots. Submit on canvas, midnight Tuesday of Week 7.

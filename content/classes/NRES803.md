We will cover a broad sample of statistical topics relevant to ecologists; the intent is to provide an introduction enabling student to intelligently follow a seminar or scientific paper utilizing these methods. Depending on the needs and interests of the students we will enable students to conduct analyses on their own for a subset of topics. Across all topics we will emphasize modern methods of model selection/multi-model inference and relevant study design questions. Topics will include generalized linear and additive models, mixed models, and survival analysis. We will use the software package R. Each student will present a data analysis problem of their choice, implement an ecological analysis, and prepare a written paper summarizing the analysis and results.

## Statement on Diversity

I want our classroom to be a safe and inclusive place for all. Every individual is valued, has the capability to succeed and has something to offer the class. While our class may only be a temporary solace from the fear, suffering or depression you may be facing in your day as a result of racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, legal/immigration status, political belief, or any other discrimination, know that I am always here for you. My door is always open.

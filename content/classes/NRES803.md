We will cover a broad sample of statistical topics relevant to ecologists; the intent is to provide an introduction enabling student to intelligently follow a seminar or scientific paper utilizing these methods. Depending on the needs and interests of the students we will enable students to conduct analyses on their own for a subset of topics. Across all topics we will emphasize modern methods of model selection/multi-model inference and relevant study design questions. Topics will include generalized linear and additive models, mixed models, and survival analysis. We will use the software package R. Each student will present a data analysis problem of their choice, implement an ecological analysis, and prepare a written paper summarizing the analysis and results.
